                           Coming Attraction



                            BY FRITZ LEIBER



                       Illustrated by Paul Calle

           Women will always go on trying to attract men ...

             even when the future seems to have no future!





The coupe with the fishhooks welded to the fender shouldered up over

the curb like the nose of a nightmare. The girl in its path stood

frozen, her face probably stiff with fright under her mask. For once my

reflexes weren't shy. I took a fast step toward her, grabbed her elbow,

yanked her back. Her black skirt swirled out.



The big coupe shot by, its turbine humming. I glimpsed three faces.

Something ripped. I felt the hot exhaust on my ankles as the big

coupe swerved back into the street. A thick cloud like a black flower

blossomed from its jouncing rear end, while from the fishhooks flew a

black shimmering rag.



""Did they get you?"" I asked the girl.



She had twisted around to look where the side of her skirt was torn

away. She was wearing nylon tights.



""The hooks didn't touch me,"" she said shakily. ""I guess I'm lucky.""



I heard voices around us:



""Those kids! What'll they think up next?""



""They're a menace. They ought to be arrested.""



Sirens screamed at a rising pitch as two motor-police, their

rocket-assist jets full on, came whizzing toward us after the coupe.

But the black flower had become a thick fog obscuring the whole street.

The motor-police switched from rocket assists to rocket brakes and

swerved to a stop near the smoke cloud.



""Are you English?"" the girl asked me. ""You have an English accent.""



Her voice came shudderingly from behind the sleek black satin mask.

I fancied her teeth must be chattering. Eyes that were perhaps blue

searched my face from behind the black gauze covering the eyeholes of

the mask. I told her she'd guessed right. She stood close to me. ""Will

you come to my place tonight?"" she asked rapidly. ""I can't thank you

now. And there's something you can help me about.""



My arm, still lightly circling her waist, felt her body trembling. I

was answering the plea in that as much as in her voice when I said,

""Certainly."" She gave me an address south of Inferno, an apartment

number and a time. She asked me my name and I told her.



""Hey, you!""



I turned obediently to the policeman's shout. He shooed away the small

clucking crowd of masked women and barefaced men. Coughing from the

smoke that the black coupe had thrown out, he asked for my papers. I

handed him the essential ones.



       *       *       *       *       *



He looked at them and then at me. ""British Barter? How long will you be

in New York?""



Suppressing the urge to say, ""For as short a time as possible,"" I told

him I'd be here for a week or so.



""May need you as a witness,"" he explained. ""Those kids can't use smoke

on us. When they do that, we pull them in.""



He seemed to think the smoke was the bad thing. ""They tried to kill the

lady,"" I pointed out.



He shook his head wisely. ""They always pretend they're going to, but

actually they just want to snag skirts. I've picked up rippers with

as many as fifty skirt-snags tacked up in their rooms. Of course,

sometimes they come a little too close.""



I explained that if I hadn't yanked her out of the way, she'd have been

hit by more than hooks. But he interrupted, ""If she'd thought it was a

real murder attempt, she'd have stayed here.""



I looked around. It was true. She was gone.



""She was fearfully frightened,"" I told him.



""Who wouldn't be? Those kids would have scared old Stalin himself.""



""I mean frightened of more than 'kids.' They didn't look like 'kids.'""



""What did they look like?""



I tried without much success to describe the three faces. A vague

impression of viciousness and effeminacy doesn't mean much.



""Well, I could be wrong,"" he said finally. ""Do you know the girl? Where

she lives?""



""No,"" I half lied.



The other policeman hung up his radiophone and ambled toward us,

kicking at the tendrils of dissipating smoke. The black cloud no longer

hid the dingy facades with their five-year-old radiation flash-burns,

and I could begin to make out the distant stump of the Empire State

Building, thrusting up out of Inferno like a mangled finger.



""They haven't been picked up so far,"" the approaching policeman

grumbled. ""Left smoke for five blocks, from what Ryan says.""



The first policeman shook his head. ""That's bad,"" he observed solemnly.



I was feeling a bit uneasy and ashamed. An Englishman shouldn't lie, at

least not on impulse.



""They sound like nasty customers,"" the first policeman continued in the

same grim tone. ""We'll need witnesses. Looks as if you may have to stay

in New York longer than you expect.""



I got the point. I said, ""I forgot to show you all my papers,"" and

handed him a few others, making sure there was a five dollar bill in

among them.



       *       *       *       *       *



When he handed them back a bit later, his voice was no longer ominous.

My feelings of guilt vanished. To cement our relationship, I chatted

with the two of them about their job.



""I suppose the masks give you some trouble,"" I observed. ""Over in

England we've been reading about your new crop of masked female

bandits.""



""Those things get exaggerated,"" the first policeman assured me. ""It's

the men masking as women that really mix us up. But, brother, when we

nab them, we jump on them with both feet.""



""And you get so you can spot women almost as well as if they had naked

faces,"" the second policeman volunteered. ""You know, hands and all

that.""



""Especially all that,"" the first agreed with a chuckle. ""Say, is it

true that some girls don't mask over in England?""



""A number of them have picked up the fashion,"" I told him. ""Only a few,

though--the ones who always adopt the latest style, however extreme.""



""They're usually masked in the British newscasts.""



""I imagine it's arranged that way out of deference to American taste,""

I confessed. ""Actually, not very many do mask.""



The second policeman considered that. ""Girls going down the street bare

from the neck up."" It was not clear whether he viewed the prospect with

relish or moral distaste. Likely both.



""A few members keep trying to persuade Parliament to enact a law

forbidding all masking,"" I continued, talking perhaps a bit too much.



The second policeman shook his head. ""What an idea. You know, masks are

a pretty good thing, brother. Couple of years more and I'm going to

make my wife wear hers around the house.""



The first policeman shrugged. ""If women were to stop wearing masks, in

six weeks you wouldn't know the difference. You get used to anything,

if enough people do or don't do it.""



I agreed, rather regretfully, and left them. I turned north on Broadway

(old Tenth Avenue, I believe) and walked rapidly until I was beyond

Inferno. Passing such an area of undecontaminated radioactivity always

makes a person queasy. I thanked God there weren't any such in England,

as yet.



The street was almost empty, though I was accosted by a couple of

beggars with faces tunneled by H-bomb scars, whether real or of makeup

putty, I couldn't tell. A fat woman held out a baby with webbed fingers

and toes. I told myself it would have been deformed anyway and that she

was only capitalizing on our fear of bomb-induced mutations. Still,

I gave her a seven-and-a-half-cent piece. Her mask made me feel I was

paying tribute to an African fetish.



""May all your children be blessed with one head and two eyes, sir.""



""Thanks,"" I said, shuddering, and hurried past her.



""... There's only trash behind the mask, so turn your head, stick to

your task: Stay away, stay away--from--the--girls!""



       *       *       *       *       *



This last was the end of an anti-sex song being sung by some

religionists half a block from the circle-and-cross insignia of a

femalist temple. They reminded me only faintly of our small tribe

of British monastics. Above their heads was a jumble of billboards

advertising predigested foods, wrestling instruction, radio handies and

the like.



I stared at the hysterical slogans with disagreeable fascination. Since

the female face and form have been banned on American signs, the very

letters of the advertiser's alphabet have begun to crawl with sex--the

fat-bellied, big-breasted capital B, the lascivious double O. However,

I reminded myself, it is chiefly the mask that so strangely accents sex

in America.



A British anthropologist has pointed out, that, while it took more

than 5,000 years to shift the chief point of sexual interest from the

hips to the breasts, the next transition to the face has taken less

than 50 years. Comparing the American style with Moslem tradition is

not valid; Moslem women are compelled to wear veils, the purpose of

which is concealment, while American women have only the compulsion of

fashion and use masks to create mystery.



Theory aside, the actual origins of the trend are to be found in

the anti-radiation clothing of World War III, which led to masked

wrestling, now a fantastically popular sport, and that in turn led to

the current female fashion. Only a wild style at first, masks quickly

became as necessary as brassieres and lipsticks had been earlier in the

century.



I finally realized that I was not speculating about masks in general,

but about what lay behind one in particular. That's the devil of the

things; you're never sure whether a girl is heightening loveliness

or hiding ugliness. I pictured a cool, pretty face in which fear

showed only in widened eyes. Then I remembered her blonde hair, rich

against the blackness of the satin mask. She'd told me to come at the

twenty-second hour--ten p.m.



I climbed to my apartment near the British Consulate; the elevator

shaft had been shoved out of plumb by an old blast, a nuisance in these

tall New York buildings. Before it occurred to me that I would be

going out again, I automatically tore a tab from the film strip under

my shirt. I developed it just to be sure. It showed that the total

radiation I'd taken that day was still within the safety limit. I'm

not phobic about it, as so many people are these days, but there's no

point in taking chances.



I flopped down on the day bed and stared at the silent speaker and the

dark screen of the video set. As always, they made me think, somewhat

bitterly, of the two great nations of the world. Mutilated by each

other, yet still strong, they were crippled giants poisoning the planet

with their dreams of an impossible equality and an impossible success.



I fretfully switched on the speaker. By luck, the newscaster was

talking excitedly of the prospects of a bumper wheat crop, sown by

planes across a dust bowl moistened by seeded rains. I listened

carefully to the rest of the program (it was remarkably clear of

Russian telejamming) but there was no further news of interest to

me. And, of course, no mention of the Moon, though everyone knows

that America and Russia are racing to develop their primary bases

into fortresses capable of mutual assault and the launching of

alphabet-bombs toward Earth. I myself knew perfectly well that the

British electronic equipment I was helping trade for American wheat was

destined for use in spaceships.



       *       *       *       *       *



I switched off the newscast. It was growing dark and once again I

pictured a tender, frightened face behind a mask. I hadn't had a date

since England. It's exceedingly difficult to become acquainted with a

girl in America, where as little as a smile, often, can set one of them

yelping for the police--to say nothing of the increasing puritanical

morality and the roving gangs that keep most women indoors after dark.

And naturally, the masks which are definitely not, as the Soviets

claim, a last invention of capitalist degeneracy, but a sign of great

psychological insecurity. The Russians have no masks, but they have

their own signs of stress.



I went to the window and impatiently watched the darkness gather. I was

getting very restless. After a while a ghostly violet cloud appeared to

the south. My hair rose. Then I laughed. I had momentarily fancied it a

radiation from the crater of the Hell-bomb, though I should instantly

have known it was only the radio-induced glow in the sky over the

amusement and residential area south of Inferno.



Promptly at twenty-two hours I stood before the door of my unknown girl

friend's apartment. The electronic say-who-please said just that. I

answered clearly, ""Wysten Turner,"" wondering if she'd given my name to

the mechanism. She evidently had, for the door opened. I walked into a

small empty living room, my heart pounding a bit.



The room was expensively furnished with the latest pneumatic hassocks

and sprawlers. There were some midgie books on the table. The one I

picked up was the standard hard-boiled detective story in which two

female murderers go gunning for each other.



The television was on. A masked girl in green was crooning a love song.

Her right hand held something that blurred off into the foreground.

I saw the set had a handie, which we haven't in England as yet, and

curiously thrust my hand into the handie orifice beside the screen.

Contrary to my expectations, it was not like slipping into a pulsing

rubber glove, but rather as if the girl on the screen actually held my

hand.



A door opened behind me. I jerked out my hand with as guilty a reaction

as if I'd been caught peering through a keyhole.



She stood in the bedroom doorway. I think she was trembling. She was

wearing a gray fur coat, white-speckled, and a gray velvet evening

mask with shirred gray lace around the eyes and mouth. Her fingernails

twinkled like silver.



It hadn't occurred to me that she'd expect us to go out.



""I should have told you,"" she said softly. Her mask veered nervously

toward the books and the screen and the room's dark corners. ""But I

can't possibly talk to you here.""



I said doubtfully, ""There's a place near the Consulate....""



""I know where we can be together and talk,"" she said rapidly. ""If you

don't mind.""



As we entered the elevator I said, ""I'm afraid I dismissed the cab.""



       *       *       *       *       *



But the cab driver hadn't gone for some reason of his own. He jumped

out and smirkingly held the front door open for us. I told him we

preferred to sit in back. He sulkily opened the rear door, slammed it

after us, jumped in front and slammed the door behind him.



My companion leaned forward. ""Heaven,"" she said.



The driver switched on the turbine and televisor.



""Why did you ask if I were a British subject?"" I said, to start the

conversation.



She leaned away from me, tilting her mask close to the window. ""See the

Moon,"" she said in a quick, dreamy voice.



""But why, really?"" I pressed, conscious of an irritation that had

nothing to do with her.



""It's edging up into the purple of the sky.""



""And what's your name?""



""The purple makes it look yellower.""



       *       *       *       *       *



Just then I became aware of the source of my irritation. It lay in the

square of writhing light in the front of the cab beside the driver.



I don't object to ordinary wrestling matches, though they bore me, but

I simply detest watching a man wrestle a woman. The fact that the bouts

are generally ""on the level,"" with the man greatly outclassed in weight

and reach and the masked females young and personable, only makes them

seem worse to me.



""Please turn off the screen,"" I requested the driver.



He shook his head without looking around. ""Uh-uh, man,"" he said.

""They've been grooming that babe for weeks for this bout with Little

Zirk.""



Infuriated, I reached forward, but my companion caught my arm.

""Please,"" she whispered frightenedly, shaking her head.



I settled back, frustrated. She was closer to me now, but silent and

for a few moments I watched the heaves and contortions of the powerful

masked girl and her wiry masked opponent on the screen. His frantic

scrambling at her reminded me of a male spider.



I jerked around, facing my companion. ""Why did those three men want to

kill you?"" I asked sharply.



The eyeholes of her mask faced the screen. ""Because they're jealous of

me,"" she whispered.



""Why are they jealous?""



She still didn't look at me. ""Because of him.""



""Who?""



She didn't answer.



I put my arm around her shoulders. ""Are you afraid to tell me?"" I

asked. ""What _is_ the matter?""



She still didn't look my way. She smelled nice.



""See here,"" I said laughingly, changing my tactics, ""you really should

tell me something about yourself. I don't even know what you look like.""



I half playfully lifted my hand to the band of her neck. She gave it an

astonishingly swift slap. I pulled it away in sudden pain. There were

four tiny indentations on the back. From one of them a tiny bead of

blood welled out as I watched. I looked at her silver fingernails and

saw they were actually delicate and pointed metal caps.



""I'm dreadfully sorry,"" I heard her say, ""but you frightened me. I

thought for a moment you were going to....""



At last she turned to me. Her coat had fallen open. Her evening dress

was Cretan Revival, a bodice of lace beneath and supporting the breasts

without covering them.



""Don't be angry,"" she said, putting her arms around my neck. ""You were

wonderful this afternoon.""



The soft gray velvet of her mask, molding itself to her cheek, pressed

mine. Through the mask's lace the wet warm tip of her tongue touched my

chin.



""I'm not angry,"" I said. ""Just puzzled and anxious to help.""



The cab stopped. To either side were black windows bordered by spears

of broken glass. The sickly purple light showed a few ragged figures

slowly moving toward us.



The driver muttered, ""It's the turbine, man. We're grounded."" He sat

there hunched and motionless. ""Wish it had happened somewhere else.""



My companion whispered, ""Five dollars is the usual amount.""



She looked out so shudderingly at the congregating figures that I

suppressed my indignation and did as she suggested. The driver took the

bill without a word. As he started up, he put his hand out the window

and I heard a few coins clink on the pavement.



My companion came back into my arms, but her mask faced the television

screen, where the tall girl had just pinned the convulsively kicking

Little Zirk.



""I'm so frightened,"" she breathed.



       *       *       *       *       *



Heaven turned out to be an equally ruinous neighborhood, but it had a

club with an awning and a huge doorman uniformed like a spaceman, but

in gaudy colors. In my sensuous daze I rather liked it all. We stepped

out of the cab just as a drunken old woman came down the sidewalk,

her mask awry. A couple ahead of us turned their heads from the half

revealed face, as if from an ugly body at the beach. As we followed

them in I heard the doorman say, ""Get along, grandma, and watch

yourself.""



Inside, everything was dimness and blue glows. She had said we could

talk here, but I didn't see how. Besides the inevitable chorus of

sneezes and coughs (they say America is fifty per cent allergic

these days), there was a band going full blast in the latest robop

style, in which an electronic composing machine selects an arbitrary

sequence of tones into which the musicians weave their raucous little

individualities.



Most of the people were in booths. The band was behind the bar. On a

small platform beside them, a girl was dancing, stripped to her mask.

The little cluster of men at the shadowy far end of the bar weren't

looking at her.



We inspected the menu in gold script on the wall and pushed the buttons

for breast of chicken, fried shrimps and two scotches. Moments later,

the serving bell tinkled. I opened the gleaming panel and took out our

drinks.



       *       *       *       *       *



The cluster of men at the bar filed off toward the door, but first they

stared around the room. My companion had just thrown back her coat.

Their look lingered on our booth. I noticed that there were three of

them.



The band chased off the dancing girl with growls. I handed my companion

a straw and we sipped our drinks.



""You wanted me to help you about something,"" I said. ""Incidentally, I

think you're lovely.""



She nodded quick thanks, looked around, leaned forward. ""Would it be

hard for me to get to England?""



""No,"" I replied, a bit taken aback. ""Provided you have an American

passport.""



""Are they difficult to get?""



""Rather,"" I said, surprised at her lack of information. ""Your country

doesn't like its nationals to travel, though it isn't quite as

stringent as Russia.""



""Could the British Consulate help me get a passport?""



""It's hardly their....""



""Could you?""



I realized we were being inspected. A man and two girls had paused

opposite our table. The girls were tall and wolfish-looking, with

spangled masks. The man stood jauntily between them like a fox on its

hind legs.



My companion didn't glance at them, but she sat back. I noticed that

one of the girls had a big yellow bruise on her forearm. After a moment

they walked to a booth in the deep shadows.



""Know them?"" I asked. She didn't reply. I finished my drink. ""I'm not

sure you'd like England,"" I said. ""The austerity's altogether different

from your American brand of misery.""



She leaned forward again. ""But I must get away,"" she whispered.



""Why?"" I was getting impatient.



""Because I'm so frightened.""



There were chimes. I opened the panel and handed her the fried shrimps.

The sauce on my breast of chicken was a delicious steaming compound of

almonds, soy and ginger. But something must have been wrong with the

radionic oven that had thawed and heated it, for at the first bite I

crunched a kernel of ice in the meat. These delicate mechanisms need

constant repair and there aren't enough mechanics.



I put down my fork. ""What are you really scared of?"" I asked her.



For once her mask didn't waver away from my face. As I waited I

could feel the fears gathering without her naming them, tiny dark

shapes swarming through the curved night outside, converging on the

radioactive pest spot of New York, dipping into the margins of the

purple. I felt a sudden rush of sympathy, a desire to protect the

girl opposite me. The warm feeling added itself to the infatuation

engendered in the cab.



""Everything,"" she said finally.



I nodded and touched her hand.



""I'm afraid of the Moon,"" she began, her voice going dreamy and brittle

as it had in the cab. ""You can't look at it and not think of guided

bombs.""



""It's the same Moon over England,"" I reminded her.



""But it's not England's Moon any more. It's ours and Russia's. You're

not responsible.""



I pressed her hand.



""Oh, and then,"" she said with a tilt of her mask, ""I'm afraid of the

cars and the gangs and the loneliness and Inferno. I'm afraid of the

lust that undresses your face. And--"" her voice hushed--""I'm afraid of

the wrestlers.""



""Yes?"" I prompted softly after a moment.



       *       *       *       *       *



Her mask came forward. ""Do you know something about the wrestlers?"" she

asked rapidly. ""The ones that wrestle women, I mean. They often lose,

you know. And then they have to have a girl to take their frustration

out on. A girl who's soft and weak and terribly frightened. They need

that, to keep them men. Other men don't want them to have a girl.

Other men want them just to fight women and be heroes. But they must

have a girl. It's horrible for her.""



I squeezed her fingers tighter, as if courage could be

transmitted--granting I had any. ""I think I can get you to England,"" I

said.



Shadows crawled onto the table and stayed there. I looked up at the

three men who had been at the end of the bar. They were the men I had

seen in the big coupe. They wore black sweaters and close-fitting black

trousers. Their faces were as expressionless as dopers. Two of them

stood above me. The other loomed over the girl.



""Drift off, man,"" I was told. I heard the other inform the girl:

""We'll wrestle a fall, sister. What shall it be? Judo, slapsie or

kill-who-can?""



I stood up. There are times when an Englishman simply must be

mal-treated. But just then the foxlike man came gliding in like the

star of a ballet. The reaction of the other three startled me. They

were acutely embarrassed.



He smiled at them thinly. ""You won't win my favor by tricks like this,""

he said.



""Don't get the wrong idea, Zirk,"" one of them pleaded.



""I will if it's right,"" he said. ""She told me what you tried to do this

afternoon. That won't endear you to me, either. Drift.""



They backed off awkwardly. ""Let's get out of here,"" one of them said

loudly, as they turned. ""I know a place where they fight naked with

knives.""



       *       *       *       *       *



Little Zirk laughed musically and slipped into the seat beside my

companion. She shrank from him, just a little. I pushed my feet back,

leaned forward.



""Who's your friend, baby?"" he asked, not looking at her.



She passed the question to me with a little gesture. I told him.



""British,"" he observed. ""She's been asking you about getting out of the

country? About passports?"" He smiled pleasantly. ""She likes to start

running away. Don't you, baby?"" His small hand began to stroke her

wrist, the fingers bent a little, the tendons ridged, as if he were

about to grab and twist.



""Look here,"" I said sharply. ""I have to be grateful to you for ordering

off those bullies, but--""



""Think nothing of it,"" he told me. ""They're no harm except when they're

behind steering wheels. A well-trained fourteen-year-old girl could

cripple any one of them. Why, even Theda here, if she went in for that

sort of thing...."" He turned to her, shifting his hand from her wrist

to her hair. He stroked it, letting the strands slip slowly through his

fingers. ""You know I lost tonight, baby, don't you?"" he said softly.



I stood up. ""Come along,"" I said to her. ""Let's leave.""



       *       *       *       *       *



She just sat there. I couldn't even tell if she was trembling. I tried

to read a message in her eyes through the mask.



""I'll take you away,"" I said to her. ""I can do it. I really will.""



He smiled at me. ""She'd like to go with you,"" he said. ""Wouldn't you,

baby?""



""Will you or won't you?"" I said to her. She still just sat there.



He slowly knotted his fingers in her hair.



""Listen, you little vermin,"" I snapped at him, ""Take your hands off

her.""



He came up from the seat like a snake. I'm no fighter. I just know that

the more scared I am, the harder and straighter I hit. This time I was

lucky. But as he crumpled back, I felt a slap and four stabs of pain in

my cheek. I clapped my hand to it. I could feel the four gashes made by

her dagger finger caps, and the warm blood oozing out from them.



She didn't look at me. She was bending over little Zirk and cuddling

her mask to his cheek and crooning: ""There, there, don't feel bad,

you'll be able to hurt me afterward.""



There were sounds around us, but they didn't come close. I leaned

forward and ripped the mask from her face.



I really don't know why I should have expected her face to be anything

else. It was very pale, of course, and there weren't any cosmetics. I

suppose there's no point in wearing any under a mask. The eye-brows

were untidy and the lips chapped. But as for the general expression, as

for the feelings crawling and wriggling across it--



Have you ever lifted a rock from damp soil? Have you ever watched the

slimy white grubs?



I looked down at her, she up at me. ""Yes, you're so frightened, aren't

you?"" I said sarcastically. ""You dread this little nightly drama, don't

you? You're scared to death.""



And I walked right out into the purple night, still holding my hand

to my bleeding cheek. No one stopped me, not even the girl wrestlers.

I wished I could tear a tab from under my shirt, and test it then and

there, and find I'd taken too much radiation, and so be able to ask to

cross the Hudson and go down New Jersey, past the lingering radiance of

the Narrows Bomb, and so on to Sandy Hook to wait for the rusty ship

that would take me back over the seas to England.

CONFIDENCE GAME



    _Cutter demanded more and more and more efficiency--and got it! But,

    as in anything, enough is enough, and too much is..._



By JAMES McKIMMEY, JR.









George H. Cutter wheeled his big convertible into his reserved space in

the Company parking lot with a flourish. A bright California sun drove

its early brightness down on him as he strode toward the square,

four-story brick building which said _Cutter Products, Inc._ over its

front door. A two-ton truck was grinding backward, toward the loading

doors, the thick-shouldered driver craning his neck. Cutter moved

briskly forward, a thick-shouldered man himself, though not very tall. A

glint of light appeared in his eyes, as he saw Kurt, the truck driver,

fitting the truck's rear end into the tight opening.



""Get that junk out of the way!"" he yelled, and his voice roared over the

noise of the truck's engine.



Kurt snapped his head around, his blue eyes thinning, then recognition

spread humor crinkles around his eyes and mouth. ""All right, sir,"" he

said. ""Just a second while I jump out, and I'll lift it out of your

way.""



""With bare hands?"" Cutter said.



""With bare hands,"" Kurt said.



Cutter's laugh boomed, and as he rounded the front of the truck, he

struck the right front fender with his fist. Kurt roared back from the

cab with his own laughter.



He liked joking harshly with Kurt and with the rest of the truck

drivers. They were simple, and they didn't have his mental strength. But

they had another kind of strength. They had muscle and energy, and most

important, they had guts. Twenty years before Cutter had driven a truck

himself. The drivers knew that, and there was a bond between them, the

drivers and himself, that seldom existed between employer and employee.



The guard at the door came to a reflex attention, and Cutter bobbed his

head curtly. Then, instead of taking the stairway that led up the front

to the second floor and his office, he strode down the hallway to the

left, angling through the shop on the first floor. He always walked

through the shop. He liked the heavy driving sound of the machines in

his ears, and the muscled look of the men, in their coarse work shirts

and heavy-soled shoes. Here again was strength, in the machines and in

the men.



[Illustration]



And here again too, the bond between Cutter and his employees was a

thing as real as the whir and grind and thump of the machines, as real

as the spray of metal dust, spitting away from a spinning saw blade. He

was able to drive himself through to them, through the hard wall of

unions and prejudices against business suits and white collars and soft

clean hands, because they knew that at one time he had also been a

machinist and then tool and die operator and then a shop foreman. He got

through to them, and they respected him. They were even inspired by him,

Cutter knew, by his energy and alertness and steel confidence. It was

one good reason why their production continually skimmed along near the

top level of efficiency.



Cutter turned abruptly and started up the metal-lipped concrete steps to

the second floor. He went up quickly, his square, almost chunky figure

moving smoothly, and there was not the faintest shortening in his breath

when he reached the level of his own office.



Coming up the back steps required him to cross the entire administration

office which contained the combined personnel of Production Control,

Procurement, and Purchasing. And here, the sharp edge of elation,

whetted by the walk past the loading dock and the truck drivers and the

machine shop and the machinists, was dulled slightly.



On either side of him as he paced rapidly across the room, were the rows

of light-oak desks which contained the kind of men he did not like:

fragile men, whether thin or fat, fragile just the same, in the eyes and

mouth, and pale with their fragility. They affected steel postures

behind those desks, but Cutter knew that the steel was synthetic, that

there was nothing in that mimicked look of alertness and virility but

posing. They were a breed he did not understand, because he had never

been a part of them, and so this time, the invisible but very real

quality of employer-employee relationship turned coldly brittle, like

frozen cellophane.



The sounds now, the clicking of typewriters, the sliding of file

drawers, the squeak of adjusted swivel chairs--all of it--irritated him,

rather than giving him inspiration, and so he hurried his way,

especially when he passed that one fellow with the sad, frightened eyes,

who touched his slim hands at the papers on his desk, like a cautious

fawn testing the soundness of the earth in front of him. What was his

name? Linden? God, Cutter thought, the epitome of the breed, this man:

sallow and slow and so hesitant that he appeared to be about to leap

from his chair at the slightest alarm.



Cutter broke his aloofness long enough to glare at the man, and Linden

turned his frightened eyes quickly to his desk and began shuffling his

papers nervously. Some day, Cutter promised himself, he was going to

stop in front of the man and shout, ""Booo!"" and scare the poor devil to

hell and back.



He pushed the glass doors that led to his own offices, and moving into

Lucile's ante-room restored his humor. Lucile, matronly yet quick and

youthfully spirited, smiled at him and met his eyes directly. Here was

some strength again, and he felt the full energy of his early-morning

drive returning fully. Lucile, behind her desk in this plain but

expensive reception room, reminded him of fast, hard efficiency, the

quality of accomplishment that he had dedicated himself to.



""Goddamned sweet morning, eh, Lucy?"" he called.



""Beautiful, George,"" she said. She had called him by his first name for

years. He didn't mind, from her. Not many could do it, but those who

could, successfully, he respected.



""What's up first?"" he asked, and she followed him into his own office.

It was a high-ceilinged room, with walls bare except for a picture of

Alexander Hamilton on one wall, and an award plaque from the State

Chamber of Commerce on the opposite side of the room. He spun his

leather-cushioned swivel chair toward him and sat down and placed his

thick hands against the surface of the desk. Lucile took the only other

chair in the office, to the side of the desk, and flipped open her

appointment pad.



""Quay wants to see you right away. Says it's important.""



Cutter nodded slightly and closed his eyes. Lucile went on, calling his

appointments for the day with clicking precision. He stored the

information, leaning back in his chair, adjusting his mind to each, so

that there would be no energy wasted during the hard, swift day.



""That's it,"" Lucile said. ""Do you want to see Quay?""



""Send him in,"" Cutter said, and he was already leaning into his desk,

signing his name to the first of a dozen letters which he had dictated

into the machine during the last ten minutes of the preceding day.



Lucile disappeared, and three minutes later Robert Quay took her place

in the chair beside Cutter's desk. He was a taller man than Cutter, and

thinner. Still, there was an athletic grace about him, a sureness of

step and facial expression, that made it obvious that he was physically

fit. He was single and only thirty-five, twelve years younger than

Cutter, but he had been with Cutter Products, Inc. for thirteen years.

In college he had been a Phi Beta Kappa and lettered three years on the

varsity as a quarterback. He was the kind of rare combination that

Cutter liked, and Cutter had offered him more than the Chicago Cardinals

to get him at graduation.



Cutter felt Quay's presence, without looking up at him. ""Goddamned sweet

morning, eh, Bob?""



""It really is, George,"" Quay said.



""What's up?"" Cutter stopped signing, having finished the entire job, and

he stared directly into Quay's eyes. Quay met the stare unflinchingly.



""I've got a report from Sid Perry at Adacam Research.""



""Your under-cover agent again, eh?""



Quay grinned. Adacam Research conducted industrial experimentation which

included government work. The only way to find out what really went on

there, Cutter had found out, was to find a key man who didn't mind

talking for a certain amount of compensation, regardless of sworn oaths

and signatures to government statements. You could always get somebody,

Cutter knew, and Quay had been able to get a young chemist, Sidney

Perry.



""Okay,"" Cutter said. ""What are they doing over there?""



""There's a fellow who's offered Adacam his project for testing. They're

highly interested, but they're not going to handle it.""



""Why not?""



Quay shrugged. ""Too touchy. It's a device that's based on electronics--""



""What the hell is touchy about electronics?""



""This deals with the human personality,"" Quay said, as though that were

explanation enough.



Cutter understood. He snorted. ""Christ, anything that deals with the

human personality scares them over there, doesn't it?""



Quay spread his hands.



""All right,"" Cutter said. ""What's this device supposed to do?""



""The theory behind it is to produce energy units which reach a plane of

intensity great enough to affect the function of the human ego.""



""Will it?"" Cutter never wasted time on surprise or curiosity or theory.

His mind acted directly. Would it or wouldn't it? Performance versus

non-performance. Efficiency versus inefficiency. Would it improve

production of Cutter Products, Inc., or would it not?



""Sid swears they're convinced it will. The factors, on paper, check out.

But there's been no experimentation, because it involves the human

personality. This thing, when used, is supposed to perform a definite

personality change on the individual subjected.""



""How?""



""You know the theory of psychiatric therapy--the theory of shock

treatment. The effect is some what similar, but a thousand times more

effective.""



""What _is_ the effect?""



""A gradual dissolving of inferiority influences, or inhibitions, from

the personality. A clear mind resulting. A healthy ego.""



""And?""



""Confidence.""



Cutter stared at Quay's eyes, assimilating the information. ""That's all

very damned nice. Now where does it fit in with Cutter Products?""



Quay drew a notebook from his coat pocket swiftly. ""You remember that

efficiency check we had made two months ago--the rating of individual

departments on comparable work produced?""



Cutter nodded.



Quay looked at his notebook. ""All administrative personnel departments

showed an average of--""



""Thirty-six point eight less efficiency than the skilled and unskilled

labor departments,"" Cutter finished.



Quay smiled slightly. He snapped the notebook shut. ""Right. So that's

our personnel efficiency bug.""



""Christ, I've known that for twenty years,"" Cutter snapped.



""Okay,"" Quay said quickly, alerting himself back to the serious effort.

""Now then, you'll remember we submitted this efficiency report to

Babcock and Steele for analysis, and their report offered no answer,

because their experience showed that you _always_ get that kind of

ratio, because of personality differences. The administrative personnel

show more inferiority influences per man, thus less confidence, thus

less efficiency.""



""I remember all that,"" Cutter said.



""Their report also pointed out that this inevitable loss of efficiency

is leveled out, by proportionately smaller wage compensation. The

administrative personnel gets approximately twenty-five percent less

compensation than the skilled labor personnel, and the remaining eleven

point eight percent loss of efficiency is made up by the more highly

efficient unskilled labor receiving approximately the same compensation

as the administrative personnel.""



""I remember all that nonsense, too,"" Cutter reddened faintly with a

sudden anger. He did not believe the statistics were nonsense, only that

you should expect to write off a thirty-six point eight efficiency loss

on the basis of adjusted compensation. A thirty-six point eight

efficiency loss was a comparable loss in profits. You never compensated

a loss in profits, except by erasing that loss. ""And so this is supposed

to fix it?""



Quay's head bobbed. ""It's worth a try, it seems to me. I've talked to

Sid about it extensively, and he tells me that Bolen, who's developed

this thing, would be willing to install enough units to cover the entire

administrative force, from the department-head level down.""



""How?""



Quay motioned a hand. ""It's no larger than a slightly thick saucer. It

could be put inside the chairs."" Quay smiled faintly. ""They sit on it,

you see, and--""



Cutter was not amused. ""How much?""



""Nothing,"" Quay said quickly. ""Absolutely nothing. Bolen wants actual

tests badly, and the Institute wouldn't do it. Snap your fingers, and

give him a hundred and fifty people to work on, and it's yours to use

for nothing. He'll do the installing, and he _wants_ to keep it secret.

It's essential, he says, to get an accurate reaction from the subjects

affected. For him it's perfect, because we're running a continuous

efficiency check, and if this thing does the job like it's supposed to

do it, we'll have gained the entire benefits for nothing. How can we

lose?""



Cutter stared at Quay for a moment, his mind working swiftly. ""Call

Horner in on this, but nobody else. Absolutely nobody else. Tell Horner

to write up a contract for this fellow to sign. Get a clause in there to

the effect that this fellow, Bolen, assumes all responsibility for any

effects not designated in the defining part of the contract. Fix it up

so that he's entirely liable, then get it signed, and let's see what

happens.""



Quay smiled fully and stood up. ""Right, sir."" He had done a good job, he

knew. This was the sort of thing that would keep him solidly entrenched

in Cutter's favor. ""Right, George,"" he said, remembering that he didn't

need to call Cutter sir anymore, but he knew he wouldn't hear any more

from Cutter, because Cutter was already looking over a blueprint, eyes

thin and careful, mind completely adjusted to a new problem.



       *       *       *       *       *



Edward Bolen called the saucer-sized disk, the Confidet. He was a thin,

short, smiling man with fine brown hair which looked as though it had

just been ruffled by a high wind, and he moved, Cutter noticed, with

quick, but certain motions. The installing was done two nights after

Cutter's lawyer, Horner, had written up the contract and gotten it

signed by Bolen. Only Quay, Bolen, and Cutter were present.



Bolen fitted the disks into the base of the plastic chair cushions, and

he explained, as he inserted one, then another:



""The energy is inside each one, you see. The life of it is indefinite,

and the amount of energy used is proportionate to the demand created.""



""What the hell do you mean by energy?"" Cutter demanded, watching the

small man work.



Bolen laughed contentedly, and Quay flushed with embarrassment over

anyone laughing at a question out of Cutter's lips. But Cutter did not

react, only looked at Bolen, as though he could see somehow, beneath

that smallness and quietness, a certain strength. Quay had seen that

look on Cutter's face before, and it meant simply that Cutter would

wait, analyzing expertly in the meantime, until he found his advantage.

Quay wondered, if this gadget worked, how long Bolen would own the

rights to it.





Cutter drove the Cadillac into Hallery Boulevard, as though the

automobile were an English Austin, and just beyond the boundaries of the

city, cut off into the hills, sliding into the night and the relative

darkness of the exclusive, sparsely populated Green Oaks section.



Ten minutes later, his house, a massive stone structure which looked as

though it had been shifted intact from the center of some medieval moat,

loomed up, gray and stony, and Capra, his handyman, took over the car

and drove it into the garage, while Cutter strode up the wide steps to

the door.



Niels took his hat, and Mary was waiting for him in the library.



She was a rather large woman, although not fat, and when she wore high

heels--which she was not prone to do, because although Cutter would not

have cared, she kept trying to project into other people's minds and

trying, as she said, ""Not to do anything to them, that I wouldn't want

them to do to me.""--she rose a good inch above Cutter. She was pleasant

humored, and cooperative, and the one great irritant about her that

annoyed Cutter, was the fact that she was not capable of meeting life

wholeheartedly and with strength.



She steadily worried about other people's feelings and thoughts, so that

Cutter wondered if she were capable of the slightest personal

conviction. Yet that weakness was an advantage at the same time, to him,

because she worked constantly toward making him happy. The house was run

to his minutest liking, and the servants liked her, so that while she

did not use a strong enough hand, they somehow got things done for her,

and Cutter had no real complaint. Someday, he knew, he would be able to

develop her into the full potential he knew she was capable of

achieving, and then there wouldn't be even that one annoyance about her.



He sat down in the large, worn, leather chair, and she handed him a

Scotch and water, and kissed his cheek, and then sat down opposite him

in a smaller striped-satin chair.



""Did you have a nice day, dear?"" she asked.



She was always pleasant and she always smiled at him, and she was

indeed a handsome woman. They had been married but five years, and she

was almost fifteen years younger than he, but they had a solid

understanding. She respected his work, and she was careful with the

money he allowed her, and she never forgot the Scotch and water. ""The

day was all right,"" he said.



""My goodness,"" she said, ""you worked late. Do you want dinner right

away?""



""I had some sandwiches at the office,"" he said, drinking slowly.



""That isn't enough,"" she said reproachfully, and he enjoyed her concern

over him. ""You'd better have some nice roast beef that Andre did just

perfectly. And there's some wonderful dressing that I made myself, for

just a small salad.""



He smiled finally. ""All right,"" he said. ""All right.""



She got up and kissed him again, and he relaxed in the large chair,

sipping contentedly at his drink, listening to her footsteps hurrying

away, the sound another indication that she was doing something for him.

He felt tired and easy. He let his mind relax with his body. The gadget,

the Confidet; that was going to work, he knew. It would erase the last

important bug in his operational efficiency, and then he might even

expand, the way he had wanted to all along. He closed his eyes for a

moment, tasting of his contentment, and then he heard the sound of his

dinner being placed on the dining room table, and he stood up briskly

and walked out of the library. He really was hungry, he realized. Not

only hungry but, he thought, he might make love to Mary that evening.



       *       *       *       *       *



The first indication that the Confidet might be working, came three

weeks later, when Quay handed Cutter the report showing an efficiency

increase of 3.7 percent. ""I think that should tell the story,"" Quay said

elatedly.



""Doesn't mean anything,"" Cutter said. ""Could be a thousand other factors

besides that damned gimmick.""



""But we've never been able to show more than one point five variance on

the administrative checks.""



""The trouble with you, Quay,"" Cutter said brusquely, ""is you keep

looking for miracles. You think the way to get things in this world is

to hope real hard. Nothing comes easy, and I've got half a notion to get

those damned silly things jerked out."" He bent over his work, obviously

finished with Quay, and Quay, deflated, paced out of the office.



Cutter smiled inside the empty office. He liked to see Quay's enthusiasm

broken now and then. It took that, to mold a really good man, because

that way he assumed real strength after a while. If he got knocked down

and got up enough, he didn't fall apart when he hit a really tough

obstacle. Cutter was not unhappy about the efficiency figures at all,

and he knew as well as Quay that they were decisive.



Give it another two weeks, he thought, and if the increase was

comparable, then they might have a real improvement on their hands.

Those limp, jumpy creatures on the desks out there might actually start

earning their keep. He was thinking about that, what it would mean to

the total profit, when Lucile opened his door and he caught a glimpse of

the office outside, including the clerk with the sad, frightened eyes.

Even you, Linden, Cutter thought, we might even improve you.





The increase _was_ comparable after another two weeks. In fact, the

efficiency figure jumped to 8.9. Quay was too excited to be knocked down

this time, and Cutter was unable to suppress his own pleasure.



""This is really it this time, George,"" Quay said. ""It really is. And

here."" He handed Cutter a set of figures. ""Here's what accounting

estimates the profit to be on this eight-nine figure.""



Cutter nodded, his eyes thinning the slightest bit. ""We won't see that

for a while.""



""No,"" Quay said, ""but we'll see it! We'll sure as hell see it! And if it

goes much higher, we'll absolutely balance out!""



""What does Bolen figure the top to be?""



""Ten percent.""



""Why not thirty-six point eight?"" Cutter said, his eyes bright and

narrow.



Quay whistled. ""Even at ten, at the wage we're paying--""



""Never settle for quarters or thirds,"" Cutter said. ""Get the whole

thing. Send for Bolen. I want to talk to him. And in the meantime, Bob,

this is such a goddamned sweet morning, what do you say we go to lunch

early?""



Quay blinked only once, which proved his adaptability. Cutter had just

asked him to lunch, as though it were their habit to lunch together

regularly, when in reality, Quay had never once gone to lunch with

Cutter before. Quay was quite nonchalant, however, and he said, ""Why,

fine, George. I think that's a good idea.""



       *       *       *       *       *



Bolen appeared in Cutter's office the next morning, smiling, his eyes

darting quickly about Cutter's desk and walls, so that Cutter felt, for

a moment, that showing Bolen anything as personal as his office, was a

little like letting the man look into his brain.



""Quay tells me you've set ten percent as the top efficiency increase we

can count on, Bolen."" Cutter said it directly, to the point.



Bolen smiled, examining Cutter's hands and suit and eyes. ""That's right,

Mr. Cutter.""



""Why?""



Bolen placed his small hands on his lap, looked at the tapered fingers,

then up again at Cutter. He kept smiling. ""It's a matter of saturation.""



""How in hell could ten percent more efficiency turn into saturation?""



""Not ten percent more efficiency,"" Bolen said quietly. ""Ten percent

_effect_ on the individual who _creates_ the efficiency. Ten percent

effect of that which _causes_ him to be ten percent more efficient.""



Cutter snorted. ""Whatever the hell that damned gimmick does, it creates

confidence, drive, strength, doesn't it? Isn't that what you said?""



""Yes,"" Bolen said politely. ""Approximately.""



""Can you explain to me then, how ten percent more confidence in a man is

saturation?""



Bolen studied what he was going to say carefully, smiling all the while.

""Some men,"" he said very slowly, ""are different than others, Mr. Cutter.

Some men will react to personality changes as abrupt as this in

different ways than others. You aren't too concerned, are you, with what

those changes might already have done to any of the individuals

affected?""



""Hell, no,"" Cutter said loudly. ""Why should I be? All I'm interested in

is efficiency. Tell me about efficiency, and I'll know what you're

talking about.""



""All right,"" Bolen said. ""We have no way of knowing right now which men

have been affected more than others. All we have is an average. The

average right now is eight and nine-tenths percent. But perhaps you have

some workers who do not react, because they really do not suffer the

lacks or compulsions or inhibitions that the Confidet is concerned with.

Perhaps they are working at top efficiency right now, and no amount of

further subjection to the Confidet will change them.""



""All right then,"" Cutter said quickly, ""we'll ferret that kind of

deadwood out, and replace them!""



""How will you know which are deadwood?"" Bolen asked pleasantly.



""Individual checks, of course!""



Bolen shook his head, looking back at his tapering fingers. ""It won't

necessarily work. You see, the work that these men are concerned with is

not particularly demanding work, is it? And that means you want to

strike a balance between capability and demand. It's the unbalance of

these things that creates trouble, and in your case, the demand

outweighed the capability. Now, if you get a total ten-percent increase,

then you're balanced. If you go over that, you'll break the balance all

over again, except that you'll have, in certain cases, capability

outweighing the demand of the work.""



""Good,"" Cutter said. ""Any man whose capability outweighs the work he's

doing will simply keep increasing his efficiency.""



Bolen shook his head. ""No. He'll react quite the other way. He'll lose

interest, because the work will no longer be a challenge, and then the

efficiency will drop.""



Cutter's jaw hardened. ""All right then. I'll move that man up, and fill

his place with someone else.""



Bolen looked at Cutter's eyes, examined them curiously. ""Some men have a

great deal of latent talent, Mr. Cutter. This talent released--""



Cutter frowned, studying Bolen carefully. Then he laughed suddenly. ""You

think I might not be able to handle it?""



""Well, let's say that you've got a stable of gentle, quiet mares, and

you turn them suddenly into thoroughbreds. You have to make allowances

for that, Mr. Cutter. The same stalls, the same railings, the same

stable boys might not be able to do the job anymore.""



""Yes,"" Cutter said, smiling without humor, ""but the _owner_ has nothing

to do with stalls and railings and stable boys, only in the sense that

they are subsidiary. The owner is the owner, and if he has to make a few

subsidiary changes, all right. But nothing really affects the owner, no

matter whether you've got gentle mares or thoroughbreds.""



Bolen nodded, as though he had expected that exact answer. ""You are a

very certain man, aren't you, Mr. Cutter?""



""Would I be here, in this office, heading this company, if I weren't,

Bolen?""



Bolen smiled.



Cutter straightened in his chair. ""All right, do we go on? Do we shoot

for the limit?""



Bolen chose his words carefully. ""I am interested in testing my

Confidet, Mr. Cutter. This is the most important thing in the world to

me. I don't recommend what you want to do. But, as long as you'll give

me accurate reports on the effects of the Confidet, I'll go along with

you. Providing you grant me one concession.""



Cutter frowned.



""I want our written contract dissolved.""



Cutter reddened faintly. Nobody ever demanded anything of him and got it

easily, but his mind turned over rapidly, judging the increase in

efficiency, the increase in profits. He would not necessarily have to

stop with administrative personnel. There were other departments, too,

that could stand a little sharpening. Finally he nodded, reluctantly.

""All right, Bolen.""



Bolen smiled and left quickly, and Cutter stared at his desk for a

moment, tense. Then, he relaxed and the hard sternness of his face

softened a bit. He put his finger on his desk calendar, and looked at a

date Lucile had circled for him. He grinned, and picked up the

telephone, and dialed.



""This is George H. Cutter,"" he said to the man who answered. ""My wife's

birthday is next Saturday. Do you remember that antique desk I bought

her last year? Good. Well, the truth is, she uses it all the time, so

this year I'd like a good chair to match it. She's just using an

occasional chair right now, and...""



       *       *       *       *       *



Like everything he gave her, Mary liked his gift extremely well, and

night after night, after the birthday, he came home to find her at the

desk, using the chair, captaining her house and her servant staff. And

the improvement was noticeable in her, almost from the first day. Within

a month, he could detect a remarkable change, and for the first time,

since they had been married, Mary gave a dinner for thirty people

without crying just before it started.



There were other changes.



Quay brought in efficiency report after efficiency report, and by the

end of three months, they had hit eighteen and seven-tenths percent

increase. The administrative office was no longer the dull, listless

place it had been; now it thrived and hummed like the shop below. Cutter

could see the difference with his own eyes, and he could particularly

see the differences in certain individuals.



Brown and Kennedy showed remarkable improvement, but it was really Harry

Linden who astonished Cutter. An individual check showed a sixty-percent

increase by Linden, and there was a definite change in the man's looks.

He walked differently, with a quick, virile step, and the look of his

face and eyes had become strong and alive. He began appearing early in

the morning, ahead of the starting hour, and working late, and the only

time he missed any work hours, was one afternoon, during which, Lucile

informed Cutter, he had appeared in court for his divorce trial.



Within a month, Cutter had fired Stole and Lackter and Grant, as

department heads, and replaced them with Brown, Kennedy, and Linden. He

had formulated plans for installation of the Confidets in the drafting

department and the supply department, and already the profits of

increased efficiency were beginning to show in the records. Cutter was

full of new enthusiasm and ambition, and there was only one thorn in the

entire development.



Quay had resigned.



Cutter had been startled and extremely angry, but Quay had been

unperturbed and stubborn. ""I've enjoyed working with you immensely,

George, but my mind is made up. No hard feelings?""



Cutter had not even shaken his hand.



It had bothered him for days, and he checked every industrial company in

the area, to see where Quay had found a better position. He was highly

surprised, when he learned, finally, that Quay had purchased a small

boat and was earning his living by carrying fishermen out onto the Bay.

Quay had also married, four days after his resignation, and Cutter

pushed the entire thing out of his mind, checking it off to partial

insanity.



By February of the next year, he had promoted Harry Linden to Quay's old

job, gotten rid of the deadwood that showed up so plainly on the

individual checks, and the total efficiency average had reached

thirty-three percent. His and Mary's anniversary was on the fourth of

March, and when that day arrived, he was certain that he had reached

that point where he could expand to another plant.



He was about to order her a mink stole in celebration, but it was also

that day that he was informed that she was suing him for divorce. He

rushed home, furious, but she was gone. She had taken her clothes and

jewelry and the second Cadillac. In fact, all that she had left of her

personal possessions were the antique desk and chair. When the trial was

over, months later, she had won enough support to take her to France,

where, he learned, she purchased a chateau at Cannes.



He tried to lose himself in his work, but for the first time in his

life, he had begun to get faintly worried. It was only a sliver of

worry, but it kept him from going on with the expansion. Stocks in the

company had turned over at an amazingly rapid rate, and while it was

still nothing more than intuition on his part, he began to tighten up,

readying himself to meet anything.



The explosion came in July.



Drindor Products had picked up forty-nine percent of the stock on the

market, by using secondary buyers. There had been a leak somewhere,

Cutter realized, that had told his competitor, Drindor, the kind of

profit he was making. He knew who it had been instantly, but before he

could fire Harry Linden, all of his walls crashed down. Four months

before, to put more _esprit de corps_ into Linden, he had allowed

Linden eight shares of his own stock, intending to pick it up later from

the market. Linden had coerced with Drindor. Cutter lost control.



A board of directors was elected by Drindor, and Drindor assumed the

presidency by proxy. Harry Linden took over Cutter's office, as Vice

President In Charge.



Cutter had wildly ordered Edward Bolen to remove the Confidets one week

before, but even then he had known that it was too late, and the

smiling, knowing look on Bolen's face had infuriated him to a screaming

rage. Bolen remained undisturbed, and quietly carried the disks away.

Cutter, when he left his office that final day, moved slowly, very

slowly.



       *       *       *       *       *



He brooded for many long days after that, searching his mind for a way

to counterattack. He still had enough stock to keep him comfortable if

he lived another hundred years. But he no longer had the power, and he

thirsted for that. He turned it around and around in his brain, trying

to figure out how he could do it, and the one thing he finally knew, the

one certain thing, was that if he used enough drive, enough strength,

then he would regain control of the company he had built with his own

hands and mind.



He paced the library and the long living room and the dining room, and

his eyes were lost, until he saw, through the doorway of the sewing

room, that desk and that chair, and he remembered he hadn't done

anything about that.



He paused only briefly, because he had not lost an ounce of his ability

to make a sudden decision, and then he removed that disk and carried it

to the library and fitted it under the cushion of the large, worn,

leather chair.





By fall, he had done nothing to regain control, and he was less certain

of how he should act than he had been months before. He kept driving by

the plant and looking at it, but he did so carefully, so that no one

would see him, and he was surprised to find that, above all, he didn't

want to face Harry Linden. The memory of the man's firm look, the sharp,

bold eyes, frightened him, and the knowledge of his fright crushed him

inside. He wished desperately that Mary were back with him, and he even

wrote her letters, pleading letters, but they came back, unopened.



Finally he went to see Robert Quay, because Quay was the only man in his

memory whom he somehow didn't fear talking to. He found Quay in a small

cottage near the beach. There was a six-day old infant in a crib in the

bedroom, and Quay's wife was a sparkling-eyed girl with a smile that

made Cutter feel relatively at ease for the first time in weeks.



She politely left them alone, and Cutter sat there, embarrassed faintly,

but glad to be in Quay's home and presence. They talked of how it had

been, when Quay was with the company, and finally Cutter pushed himself

into asking about it:



""I've often wondered, Bob, why you left?""



Quay blushed slightly, then grinned. ""I might as well admit it. I got

one of those things from Bolen, and had it installed in my own chair.""



Cutter thought about it, surprised. He cleared his throat. ""And then you

quit?""



""Sure,"" Quay said. ""All my life, I'd wanted to do just what I'm doing.

But things just came easy to me, and the opportunities were always

there, and I just never had the guts to pass anything by. Finally I

did.""



Quay smiled at him, and Cutter shifted in his chair. ""The Confidet did

that.""



Cutter nodded.



It came to him suddenly, something he'd never suspected until that

moment. There was something very definitely wrong with what had happened

to him. The Confidet had affected everyone but him; there must have been

something wrong with the one he had been using. It had worked with Mary,

but hadn't Bolen said something about the energy being used in

proportion to the demand? Mary had certainly created a demand. Bolen

said the life of it was indefinite, but couldn't the energy have been

used up?



""Ah,"" he said carefully, smiling, to Quay. ""You wouldn't have it around,

would you? That Confidet of yours?""



""Oh, hell, no,"" Quay said. ""I gave it to Bolen a long time ago. He came

around for it, in fact. Said he had to keep track of all of them.""



Cutter left hurriedly, with Quay and his wife following him to his car.

He drove straight to Bolen's house.



Fury built inside of him. All this time, Bolen had kept track of his

Confidet, the one that Mary had used, and all this time, he had known

Cutter still had it. Cutter was furious over the realization that Bolen

had been using him for experimentation, and also because the Confidet

that he had tried to use had turned worthless.



All his hatred, all his anger churned inside of him like the heat from

shaken coals, but when he walked up the path to Bolen's small house, he

did so quietly, with extreme care.



When he saw Bolen's face in the doorway, he wanted to strike the man,

but he kept his hands quietly at his sides; and though he hated himself

for it, he even smiled a little at the man.



""Come in,"" Bolen smiled, and he spoke softly, and at the same time he

examined Cutter with quick, penetrating eyes. ""Come in, Mr. Cutter.""



Cutter wanted to stand there and demand another Confidet, a good one,

and not walk inside, politely, like he did. And he wished that his voice

would come out, quickly, with the power and hate in it that he had once

been capable of. But for some reason, he couldn't say a word.



Bolen was extremely polite. ""You've been using that Confidet, haven't

you?"" He spoke gently, almost as though he were speaking to a frightened

child.



""Yes,"" Cutter managed to say.



""And what you expected to happen, didn't. That's what you want to tell

me, isn't it?""



Cutter's insides quivered with rage, but he was able only to nod.



""Would you like to know why?"" Bolen said.



Cutter rubbed his damp palms over his knees. He nodded.



Bolen smiled, his eyes sparkling. ""Very simple really. It wasn't the

fault of the Confidet so much, Mr. Cutter, as you. You see, you are a

rare exception. What you are, or possibly I should say, what you were,

was a complete super ego. There are very few of those, Mr. Cutter, in

this world, but you happened to be one of them. A really absolute,

complete super ego, and the Confidet's effect was simply the reverse of

what it would have been with anyone else."" Bolen shook his head,

sympathetically, but he didn't stop smiling, and his eyes didn't stop

their infuriating exploration of Cutter's face and eyes and hands. ""It's

really a shame, because I was almost certain you were a super ego, Mr.

Cutter. And when you didn't return that last Confidet, I somehow felt

that you might use it, after all that nasty business at the company and

all.



""But while I was fairly certain of the effects, Mr. Cutter, I wasn't

absolutely _sure_, you see, and so like the rest of the experiments, I

had to forget my conscience. I'm really very sorry.""



The anger was a wild thing inside Cutter now, and it made his hands

tremble and sweat, and his mouth quiver, and he hated the man in front

of him, the man who was responsible for what had happened to him, the

smiling man with the soft voice and exploring eyes. But he didn't say

anything, not a word. He didn't show his anger or his frustration or his

resentment. He didn't indicate to Bolen a particle of his inner

wildness.



He didn't have the nerve.

I





“Oh, there IS one, of course, but you’ll never know it.”



The assertion, laughingly flung out six months earlier in a bright June

garden, came back to Mary Boyne with a sharp perception of its latent

significance as she stood, in the December dusk, waiting for the lamps

to be brought into the library.



The words had been spoken by their friend Alida Stair, as they sat at

tea on her lawn at Pangbourne, in reference to the very house of which

the library in question was the central, the pivotal “feature.” Mary

Boyne and her husband, in quest of a country place in one of the

southern or southwestern counties, had, on their arrival in England,

carried their problem straight to Alida Stair, who had successfully

solved it in her own case; but it was not until they had rejected,

almost capriciously, several practical and judicious suggestions that

she threw it out: “Well, there’s Lyng, in Dorsetshire. It belongs to

Hugo’s cousins, and you can get it for a song.”



The reasons she gave for its being obtainable on these terms--its

remoteness from a station, its lack of electric light, hot-water pipes,

and other vulgar necessities--were exactly those pleading in its

favor with two romantic Americans perversely in search of the economic

drawbacks which were associated, in their tradition, with unusual

architectural felicities.



“I should never believe I was living in an old house unless I was

thoroughly uncomfortable,” Ned Boyne, the more extravagant of the two,

had jocosely insisted; “the least hint of ‘convenience’ would make me

think it had been bought out of an exhibition, with the pieces numbered,

and set up again.” And they had proceeded to enumerate, with humorous

precision, their various suspicions and exactions, refusing to believe

that the house their cousin recommended was REALLY Tudor till they

learned it had no heating system, or that the village church was

literally in the grounds till she assured them of the deplorable

uncertainty of the water-supply.



“It’s too uncomfortable to be true!” Edward Boyne had continued to exult

as the avowal of each disadvantage was successively wrung from her; but

he had cut short his rhapsody to ask, with a sudden relapse to distrust:

“And the ghost? You’ve been concealing from us the fact that there is no

ghost!”



Mary, at the moment, had laughed with him, yet almost with her laugh,

being possessed of several sets of independent perceptions, had noted a

sudden flatness of tone in Alida’s answering hilarity.



“Oh, Dorsetshire’s full of ghosts, you know.”



“Yes, yes; but that won’t do. I don’t want to have to drive ten miles

to see somebody else’s ghost. I want one of my own on the premises. IS

there a ghost at Lyng?”



His rejoinder had made Alida laugh again, and it was then that she had

flung back tantalizingly: “Oh, there IS one, of course, but you’ll never

know it.”



“Never know it?” Boyne pulled her up. “But what in the world constitutes

a ghost except the fact of its being known for one?”



“I can’t say. But that’s the story.”



“That there’s a ghost, but that nobody knows it’s a ghost?”



“Well--not till afterward, at any rate.”



“Till afterward?”



“Not till long, long afterward.”



“But if it’s once been identified as an unearthly visitant, why hasn’t

its signalement been handed down in the family? How has it managed to

preserve its incognito?”



Alida could only shake her head. “Don’t ask me. But it has.”



“And then suddenly--” Mary spoke up as if from some cavernous depth of

divination--“suddenly, long afterward, one says to one’s self, ‘THAT WAS

it?’”



She was oddly startled at the sepulchral sound with which her question

fell on the banter of the other two, and she saw the shadow of the same

surprise flit across Alida’s clear pupils. “I suppose so. One just has

to wait.”



“Oh, hang waiting!” Ned broke in. “Life’s too short for a ghost who can

only be enjoyed in retrospect. Can’t we do better than that, Mary?”



But it turned out that in the event they were not destined to, for

within three months of their conversation with Mrs. Stair they were

established at Lyng, and the life they had yearned for to the point of

planning it out in all its daily details had actually begun for them.



It was to sit, in the thick December dusk, by just such a wide-hooded

fireplace, under just such black oak rafters, with the sense that beyond

the mullioned panes the downs were darkening to a deeper solitude: it

was for the ultimate indulgence in such sensations that Mary Boyne had

endured for nearly fourteen years the soul-deadening ugliness of the

Middle West, and that Boyne had ground on doggedly at his engineering

till, with a suddenness that still made her blink, the prodigious

windfall of the Blue Star Mine had put them at a stroke in possession

of life and the leisure to taste it. They had never for a moment meant

their new state to be one of idleness; but they meant to give themselves

only to harmonious activities. She had her vision of painting and

gardening (against a background of gray walls), he dreamed of the

production of his long-planned book on the “Economic Basis of

Culture”; and with such absorbing work ahead no existence could be too

sequestered; they could not get far enough from the world, or plunge

deep enough into the past.



Dorsetshire had attracted them from the first by a semblance of

remoteness out of all proportion to its geographical position. But

to the Boynes it was one of the ever-recurring wonders of the whole

incredibly compressed island--a nest of counties, as they put it--that

for the production of its effects so little of a given quality went

so far: that so few miles made a distance, and so short a distance a

difference.



“It’s that,” Ned had once enthusiastically explained, “that gives such

depth to their effects, such relief to their least contrasts. They’ve

been able to lay the butter so thick on every exquisite mouthful.”



The butter had certainly been laid on thick at Lyng: the old gray house,

hidden under a shoulder of the downs, had almost all the finer marks of

commerce with a protracted past. The mere fact that it was neither large

nor exceptional made it, to the Boynes, abound the more richly in

its special sense--the sense of having been for centuries a deep, dim

reservoir of life. The life had probably not been of the most vivid

order: for long periods, no doubt, it had fallen as noiselessly into

the past as the quiet drizzle of autumn fell, hour after hour, into the

green fish-pond between the yews; but these back-waters of existence

sometimes breed, in their sluggish depths, strange acuities of emotion,

and Mary Boyne had felt from the first the occasional brush of an

intenser memory.



The feeling had never been stronger than on the December afternoon when,

waiting in the library for the belated lamps, she rose from her seat and

stood among the shadows of the hearth. Her husband had gone off, after

luncheon, for one of his long tramps on the downs. She had noticed of

late that he preferred to be unaccompanied on these occasions; and,

in the tried security of their personal relations, had been driven

to conclude that his book was bothering him, and that he needed the

afternoons to turn over in solitude the problems left from the morning’s

work. Certainly the book was not going as smoothly as she had imagined

it would, and the lines of perplexity between his eyes had never been

there in his engineering days. Then he had often looked fagged to the

verge of illness, but the native demon of “worry” had never branded his

brow. Yet the few pages he had so far read to her--the introduction, and

a synopsis of the opening chapter--gave evidences of a firm possession

of his subject, and a deepening confidence in his powers.



The fact threw her into deeper perplexity, since, now that he had done

with “business” and its disturbing contingencies, the one other possible

element of anxiety was eliminated. Unless it were his health, then?

But physically he had gained since they had come to Dorsetshire, grown

robuster, ruddier, and fresher-eyed. It was only within a week that she

had felt in him the undefinable change that made her restless in his

absence, and as tongue-tied in his presence as though it were SHE who

had a secret to keep from him!



The thought that there WAS a secret somewhere between them struck her

with a sudden smart rap of wonder, and she looked about her down the

dim, long room.



“Can it be the house?” she mused.



The room itself might have been full of secrets. They seemed to be

piling themselves up, as evening fell, like the layers and layers of

velvet shadow dropping from the low ceiling, the dusky walls of books,

the smoke-blurred sculpture of the hooded hearth.



“Why, of course--the house is haunted!” she reflected.



The ghost--Alida’s imperceptible ghost--after figuring largely in the

banter of their first month or two at Lyng, had been gradually discarded

as too ineffectual for imaginative use. Mary had, indeed, as became the

tenant of a haunted house, made the customary inquiries among her few

rural neighbors, but, beyond a vague, “They du say so, Ma’am,” the

villagers had nothing to impart. The elusive specter had apparently

never had sufficient identity for a legend to crystallize about it,

and after a time the Boynes had laughingly set the matter down to their

profit-and-loss account, agreeing that Lyng was one of the few houses

good enough in itself to dispense with supernatural enhancements.



“And I suppose, poor, ineffectual demon, that’s why it beats its

beautiful wings in vain in the void,” Mary had laughingly concluded.



“Or, rather,” Ned answered, in the same strain, “why, amid so much

that’s ghostly, it can never affirm its separate existence as THE

ghost.” And thereupon their invisible housemate had finally dropped out

of their references, which were numerous enough to make them promptly

unaware of the loss.



Now, as she stood on the hearth, the subject of their earlier curiosity

revived in her with a new sense of its meaning--a sense gradually

acquired through close daily contact with the scene of the lurking

mystery. It was the house itself, of course, that possessed the

ghost-seeing faculty, that communed visually but secretly with its own

past; and if one could only get into close enough communion with the

house, one might surprise its secret, and acquire the ghost-sight on

one’s own account. Perhaps, in his long solitary hours in this very

room, where she never trespassed till the afternoon, her husband HAD

acquired it already, and was silently carrying the dread weight of

whatever it had revealed to him. Mary was too well-versed in the code of

the spectral world not to know that one could not talk about the ghosts

one saw: to do so was almost as great a breach of good-breeding as to

name a lady in a club. But this explanation did not really satisfy her.

“What, after all, except for the fun of the frisson,” she reflected,

“would he really care for any of their old ghosts?” And thence she was

thrown back once more on the fundamental dilemma: the fact that one’s

greater or less susceptibility to spectral influences had no particular

bearing on the case, since, when one DID see a ghost at Lyng, one did

not know it.



“Not till long afterward,” Alida Stair had said. Well, supposing Ned HAD

seen one when they first came, and had known only within the last week

what had happened to him? More and more under the spell of the hour, she

threw back her searching thoughts to the early days of their tenancy,

but at first only to recall a gay confusion of unpacking, settling,

arranging of books, and calling to each other from remote corners of the

house as treasure after treasure of their habitation revealed itself to

them. It was in this particular connection that she presently recalled

a certain soft afternoon of the previous October, when, passing from the

first rapturous flurry of exploration to a detailed inspection of the

old house, she had pressed (like a novel heroine) a panel that opened at

her touch, on a narrow flight of stairs leading to an unsuspected flat

ledge of the roof--the roof which, from below, seemed to slope away on

all sides too abruptly for any but practised feet to scale.



The view from this hidden coign was enchanting, and she had flown down

to snatch Ned from his papers and give him the freedom of her discovery.

She remembered still how, standing on the narrow ledge, he had passed

his arm about her while their gaze flew to the long, tossed horizon-line

of the downs, and then dropped contentedly back to trace the arabesque

of yew hedges about the fish-pond, and the shadow of the cedar on the

lawn.



“And now the other way,” he had said, gently turning her about within

his arm; and closely pressed to him, she had absorbed, like some long,

satisfying draft, the picture of the gray-walled court, the squat lions

on the gates, and the lime-avenue reaching up to the highroad under the

downs.



It was just then, while they gazed and held each other, that she had

felt his arm relax, and heard a sharp “Hullo!” that made her turn to

glance at him.



Distinctly, yes, she now recalled she had seen, as she glanced, a shadow

of anxiety, of perplexity, rather, fall across his face; and, following

his eyes, had beheld the figure of a man--a man in loose, grayish

clothes, as it appeared to her--who was sauntering down the lime-avenue

to the court with the tentative gait of a stranger seeking his way. Her

short-sighted eyes had given her but a blurred impression of slightness

and grayness, with something foreign, or at least unlocal, in the cut of

the figure or its garb; but her husband had apparently seen more--seen

enough to make him push past her with a sharp “Wait!” and dash down the

twisting stairs without pausing to give her a hand for the descent.



A slight tendency to dizziness obliged her, after a provisional clutch

at the chimney against which they had been leaning, to follow him down

more cautiously; and when she had reached the attic landing she paused

again for a less definite reason, leaning over the oak banister to

strain her eyes through the silence of the brown, sun-flecked depths

below. She lingered there till, somewhere in those depths, she heard

the closing of a door; then, mechanically impelled, she went down the

shallow flights of steps till she reached the lower hall.



The front door stood open on the mild sunlight of the court, and

hall and court were empty. The library door was open, too, and after

listening in vain for any sound of voices within, she quickly crossed

the threshold, and found her husband alone, vaguely fingering the papers

on his desk.



He looked up, as if surprised at her precipitate entrance, but the

shadow of anxiety had passed from his face, leaving it even, as she

fancied, a little brighter and clearer than usual.



“What was it? Who was it?” she asked.



“Who?” he repeated, with the surprise still all on his side.



“The man we saw coming toward the house.”



He seemed honestly to reflect. “The man? Why, I thought I saw Peters;

I dashed after him to say a word about the stable-drains, but he had

disappeared before I could get down.”



“Disappeared? Why, he seemed to be walking so slowly when we saw him.”



Boyne shrugged his shoulders. “So I thought; but he must have got up

steam in the interval. What do you say to our trying a scramble up

Meldon Steep before sunset?”



That was all. At the time the occurrence had been less than nothing,

had, indeed, been immediately obliterated by the magic of their first

vision from Meldon Steep, a height which they had dreamed of climbing

ever since they had first seen its bare spine heaving itself above the

low roof of Lyng. Doubtless it was the mere fact of the other incident’s

having occurred on the very day of their ascent to Meldon that had kept

it stored away in the unconscious fold of association from which it now

emerged; for in itself it had no mark of the portentous. At the moment

there could have been nothing more natural than that Ned should dash

himself from the roof in the pursuit of dilatory tradesmen. It was the

period when they were always on the watch for one or the other of the

specialists employed about the place; always lying in wait for them,

and dashing out at them with questions, reproaches, or reminders. And

certainly in the distance the gray figure had looked like Peters.



Yet now, as she reviewed the rapid scene, she felt her husband’s

explanation of it to have been invalidated by the look of anxiety on his

face. Why had the familiar appearance of Peters made him anxious?

Why, above all, if it was of such prime necessity to confer with that

authority on the subject of the stable-drains, had the failure to find

him produced such a look of relief? Mary could not say that any one

of these considerations had occurred to her at the time, yet, from the

promptness with which they now marshaled themselves at her summons, she

had a sudden sense that they must all along have been there, waiting

their hour.









II





Weary with her thoughts, she moved toward the window. The library was

now completely dark, and she was surprised to see how much faint light

the outer world still held.



As she peered out into it across the court, a figure shaped itself in

the tapering perspective of bare lines: it looked a mere blot of deeper

gray in the grayness, and for an instant, as it moved toward her, her

heart thumped to the thought, “It’s the ghost!”



She had time, in that long instant, to feel suddenly that the man of

whom, two months earlier, she had a brief distant vision from the roof

was now, at his predestined hour, about to reveal himself as NOT

having been Peters; and her spirit sank under the impending fear of the

disclosure. But almost with the next tick of the clock the ambiguous

figure, gaining substance and character, showed itself even to her weak

sight as her husband’s; and she turned away to meet him, as he entered,

with the confession of her folly.



“It’s really too absurd,” she laughed out from the threshold, “but I

never CAN remember!”



“Remember what?” Boyne questioned as they drew together.



“That when one sees the Lyng ghost one never knows it.”



Her hand was on his sleeve, and he kept it there, but with no response

in his gesture or in the lines of his fagged, preoccupied face.



“Did you think you’d seen it?” he asked, after an appreciable interval.



“Why, I actually took YOU for it, my dear, in my mad determination to

spot it!”



“Me--just now?” His arm dropped away, and he turned from her with a

faint echo of her laugh. “Really, dearest, you’d better give it up, if

that’s the best you can do.”



“Yes, I give it up--I give it up. Have YOU?” she asked, turning round on

him abruptly.



The parlor-maid had entered with letters and a lamp, and the light

struck up into Boyne’s face as he bent above the tray she presented.



“Have YOU?” Mary perversely insisted, when the servant had disappeared

on her errand of illumination.



“Have I what?” he rejoined absently, the light bringing out the sharp

stamp of worry between his brows as he turned over the letters.



“Given up trying to see the ghost.” Her heart beat a little at the

experiment she was making.



Her husband, laying his letters aside, moved away into the shadow of the

hearth.



“I never tried,” he said, tearing open the wrapper of a newspaper.



“Well, of course,” Mary persisted, “the exasperating thing is that

there’s no use trying, since one can’t be sure till so long afterward.”



He was unfolding the paper as if he had hardly heard her; but after a

pause, during which the sheets rustled spasmodically between his hands,

he lifted his head to say abruptly, “Have you any idea HOW LONG?”



Mary had sunk into a low chair beside the fireplace. From her seat

she looked up, startled, at her husband’s profile, which was darkly

projected against the circle of lamplight.



“No; none. Have YOU?” she retorted, repeating her former phrase with an

added keenness of intention.



Boyne crumpled the paper into a bunch, and then inconsequently turned

back with it toward the lamp.



“Lord, no! I only meant,” he explained, with a faint tinge of

impatience, “is there any legend, any tradition, as to that?”



“Not that I know of,” she answered; but the impulse to add, “What makes

you ask?” was checked by the reappearance of the parlor-maid with tea

and a second lamp.



With the dispersal of shadows, and the repetition of the daily domestic

office, Mary Boyne felt herself less oppressed by that sense of

something mutely imminent which had darkened her solitary afternoon. For

a few moments she gave herself silently to the details of her task, and

when she looked up from it she was struck to the point of bewilderment

by the change in her husband’s face. He had seated himself near the

farther lamp, and was absorbed in the perusal of his letters; but was it

something he had found in them, or merely the shifting of her own point

of view, that had restored his features to their normal aspect? The

longer she looked, the more definitely the change affirmed itself. The

lines of painful tension had vanished, and such traces of fatigue as

lingered were of the kind easily attributable to steady mental effort.

He glanced up, as if drawn by her gaze, and met her eyes with a smile.



“I’m dying for my tea, you know; and here’s a letter for you,” he said.



She took the letter he held out in exchange for the cup she proffered

him, and, returning to her seat, broke the seal with the languid gesture

of the reader whose interests are all inclosed in the circle of one

cherished presence.



Her next conscious motion was that of starting to her feet, the letter

falling to them as she rose, while she held out to her husband a long

newspaper clipping.



“Ned! What’s this? What does it mean?”



He had risen at the same instant, almost as if hearing her cry before

she uttered it; and for a perceptible space of time he and she studied

each other, like adversaries watching for an advantage, across the space

between her chair and his desk.



“What’s what? You fairly made me jump!” Boyne said at length, moving

toward her with a sudden, half-exasperated laugh. The shadow of

apprehension was on his face again, not now a look of fixed foreboding,

but a shifting vigilance of lips and eyes that gave her the sense of his

feeling himself invisibly surrounded.



Her hand shook so that she could hardly give him the clipping.



“This article--from the ‘Waukesha Sentinel’--that a man named Elwell has

brought suit against you--that there was something wrong about the Blue

Star Mine. I can’t understand more than half.”



They continued to face each other as she spoke, and to her astonishment,

she saw that her words had the almost immediate effect of dissipating

the strained watchfulness of his look.



“Oh, THAT!” He glanced down the printed slip, and then folded it with

the gesture of one who handles something harmless and familiar. “What’s

the matter with you this afternoon, Mary? I thought you’d got bad news.”



She stood before him with her undefinable terror subsiding slowly under

the reassuring touch of his composure.



“You knew about this, then--it’s all right?”



“Certainly I knew about it; and it’s all right.”



“But what IS it? I don’t understand. What does this man accuse you of?”



“Oh, pretty nearly every crime in the calendar.” Boyne had tossed the

clipping down, and thrown himself comfortably into an arm-chair near

the fire. “Do you want to hear the story? It’s not particularly

interesting--just a squabble over interests in the Blue Star.”



“But who is this Elwell? I don’t know the name.”



“Oh, he’s a fellow I put into it--gave him a hand up. I told you all

about him at the time.”



“I daresay. I must have forgotten.” Vainly she strained back among her

memories. “But if you helped him, why does he make this return?”



“Oh, probably some shyster lawyer got hold of him and talked him over.

It’s all rather technical and complicated. I thought that kind of thing

bored you.”



His wife felt a sting of compunction. Theoretically, she deprecated the

American wife’s detachment from her husband’s professional interests,

but in practice she had always found it difficult to fix her attention

on Boyne’s report of the transactions in which his varied interests

involved him. Besides, she had felt from the first that, in a community

where the amenities of living could be obtained only at the cost of

efforts as arduous as her husband’s professional labors, such brief

leisure as they could command should be used as an escape from immediate

preoccupations, a flight to the life they always dreamed of living. Once

or twice, now that this new life had actually drawn its magic circle

about them, she had asked herself if she had done right; but hitherto

such conjectures had been no more than the retrospective excursions of

an active fancy. Now, for the first time, it startled her a little

to find how little she knew of the material foundation on which her

happiness was built.



She glanced again at her husband, and was reassured by the composure

of his face; yet she felt the need of more definite grounds for her

reassurance.



“But doesn’t this suit worry you? Why have you never spoken to me about

it?”



He answered both questions at once: “I didn’t speak of it at first

because it DID worry me--annoyed me, rather. But it’s all ancient

history now. Your correspondent must have got hold of a back number of

the ‘Sentinel.’”



She felt a quick thrill of relief. “You mean it’s over? He’s lost his

case?”



There was a just perceptible delay in Boyne’s reply. “The suit’s been

withdrawn--that’s all.”



But she persisted, as if to exonerate herself from the inward charge of

being too easily put off. “Withdrawn because he saw he had no chance?”



“Oh, he had no chance,” Boyne answered.



She was still struggling with a dimly felt perplexity at the back of her

thoughts.



“How long ago was it withdrawn?”



He paused, as if with a slight return of his former uncertainty. “I’ve

just had the news now; but I’ve been expecting it.”



“Just now--in one of your letters?”



“Yes; in one of my letters.”



She made no answer, and was aware only, after a short interval of

waiting, that he had risen, and strolling across the room, had placed

himself on the sofa at her side. She felt him, as he did so, pass an arm

about her, she felt his hand seek hers and clasp it, and turning slowly,

drawn by the warmth of his cheek, she met the smiling clearness of his

eyes.



“It’s all right--it’s all right?” she questioned, through the flood of

her dissolving doubts; and “I give you my word it never was righter!” he

laughed back at her, holding her close.









III





One of the strangest things she was afterward to recall out of all the

next day’s incredible strangeness was the sudden and complete recovery

of her sense of security.



It was in the air when she woke in her low-ceilinged, dusky room; it

accompanied her down-stairs to the breakfast-table, flashed out at her

from the fire, and re-duplicated itself brightly from the flanks of the

urn and the sturdy flutings of the Georgian teapot. It was as if, in

some roundabout way, all her diffused apprehensions of the previous

day, with their moment of sharp concentration about the newspaper

article,--as if this dim questioning of the future, and startled return

upon the past,--had between them liquidated the arrears of some haunting

moral obligation. If she had indeed been careless of her husband’s

affairs, it was, her new state seemed to prove, because her faith in him

instinctively justified such carelessness; and his right to her faith

had overwhelmingly affirmed itself in the very face of menace and

suspicion. She had never seen him more untroubled, more naturally and

unconsciously in possession of himself, than after the cross-examination

to which she had subjected him: it was almost as if he had been aware of

her lurking doubts, and had wanted the air cleared as much as she did.



It was as clear, thank Heaven! as the bright outer light that surprised

her almost with a touch of summer when she issued from the house for her

daily round of the gardens. She had left Boyne at his desk, indulging

herself, as she passed the library door, by a last peep at his quiet

face, where he bent, pipe in his mouth, above his papers, and now she

had her own morning’s task to perform. The task involved on such charmed

winter days almost as much delighted loitering about the different

quarters of her demesne as if spring were already at work on shrubs and

borders. There were such inexhaustible possibilities still before her,

such opportunities to bring out the latent graces of the old place,

without a single irreverent touch of alteration, that the winter months

were all too short to plan what spring and autumn executed. And her

recovered sense of safety gave, on this particular morning, a peculiar

zest to her progress through the sweet, still place. She went first to

the kitchen-garden, where the espaliered pear-trees drew complicated

patterns on the walls, and pigeons were fluttering and preening about

the silvery-slated roof of their cot. There was something wrong about

the piping of the hothouse, and she was expecting an authority from

Dorchester, who was to drive out between trains and make a diagnosis of

the boiler. But when she dipped into the damp heat of the greenhouses,

among the spiced scents and waxy pinks and reds of old-fashioned

exotics,--even the flora of Lyng was in the note!--she learned that the

great man had not arrived, and the day being too rare to waste in an

artificial atmosphere, she came out again and paced slowly along the

springy turf of the bowling-green to the gardens behind the house. At

their farther end rose a grass terrace, commanding, over the fish-pond

and the yew hedges, a view of the long house-front, with its twisted

chimney-stacks and the blue shadows of its roof angles, all drenched in

the pale gold moisture of the air.



Seen thus, across the level tracery of the yews, under the suffused,

mild light, it sent her, from its open windows and hospitably smoking

chimneys, the look of some warm human presence, of a mind slowly ripened

on a sunny wall of experience. She had never before had so deep a sense

of her intimacy with it, such a conviction that its secrets were

all beneficent, kept, as they said to children, “for one’s good,” so

complete a trust in its power to gather up her life and Ned’s into the

harmonious pattern of the long, long story it sat there weaving in the

sun.



She heard steps behind her, and turned, expecting to see the gardener,

accompanied by the engineer from Dorchester. But only one figure was

in sight, that of a youngish, slightly built man, who, for reasons she

could not on the spot have specified, did not remotely resemble her

preconceived notion of an authority on hot-house boilers. The

new-comer, on seeing her, lifted his hat, and paused with the air of a

gentleman--perhaps a traveler--desirous of having it immediately known

that his intrusion is involuntary. The local fame of Lyng occasionally

attracted the more intelligent sight-seer, and Mary half-expected to see

the stranger dissemble a camera, or justify his presence by producing

it. But he made no gesture of any sort, and after a moment she asked,

in a tone responding to the courteous deprecation of his attitude: “Is

there any one you wish to see?”



“I came to see Mr. Boyne,” he replied. His intonation, rather than his

accent, was faintly American, and Mary, at the familiar note, looked

at him more closely. The brim of his soft felt hat cast a shade on his

face, which, thus obscured, wore to her short-sighted gaze a look of

seriousness, as of a person arriving “on business,” and civilly but

firmly aware of his rights.



Past experience had made Mary equally sensible to such claims; but she

was jealous of her husband’s morning hours, and doubtful of his having

given any one the right to intrude on them.



“Have you an appointment with Mr. Boyne?” she asked.



He hesitated, as if unprepared for the question.



“Not exactly an appointment,” he replied.



“Then I’m afraid, this being his working-time, that he can’t receive you

now. Will you give me a message, or come back later?”



The visitor, again lifting his hat, briefly replied that he would come

back later, and walked away, as if to regain the front of the house. As

his figure receded down the walk between the yew hedges, Mary saw him

pause and look up an instant at the peaceful house-front bathed in faint

winter sunshine; and it struck her, with a tardy touch of compunction,

that it would have been more humane to ask if he had come from a

distance, and to offer, in that case, to inquire if her husband could

receive him. But as the thought occurred to her he passed out of

sight behind a pyramidal yew, and at the same moment her attention was

distracted by the approach of the gardener, attended by the bearded

pepper-and-salt figure of the boiler-maker from Dorchester.



The encounter with this authority led to such far-reaching issues that

they resulted in his finding it expedient to ignore his train, and

beguiled Mary into spending the remainder of the morning in absorbed

confabulation among the greenhouses. She was startled to find, when the

colloquy ended, that it was nearly luncheon-time, and she half expected,

as she hurried back to the house, to see her husband coming out to meet

her. But she found no one in the court but an under-gardener raking

the gravel, and the hall, when she entered it, was so silent that she

guessed Boyne to be still at work behind the closed door of the library.



Not wishing to disturb him, she turned into the drawing-room, and there,

at her writing-table, lost herself in renewed calculations of the outlay

to which the morning’s conference had committed her. The knowledge that

she could permit herself such follies had not yet lost its novelty; and

somehow, in contrast to the vague apprehensions of the previous days, it

now seemed an element of her recovered security, of the sense that, as

Ned had said, things in general had never been “righter.”



She was still luxuriating in a lavish play of figures when the

parlor-maid, from the threshold, roused her with a dubiously worded

inquiry as to the expediency of serving luncheon. It was one of their

jokes that Trimmle announced luncheon as if she were divulging a

state secret, and Mary, intent upon her papers, merely murmured an

absent-minded assent.



She felt Trimmle wavering expressively on the threshold as if in rebuke

of such offhand acquiescence; then her retreating steps sounded down the

passage, and Mary, pushing away her papers, crossed the hall, and went

to the library door. It was still closed, and she wavered in her turn,

disliking to disturb her husband, yet anxious that he should not exceed

his normal measure of work. As she stood there, balancing her impulses,

the esoteric Trimmle returned with the announcement of luncheon, and

Mary, thus impelled, opened the door and went into the library.



Boyne was not at his desk, and she peered about her, expecting to

discover him at the book-shelves, somewhere down the length of the room;

but her call brought no response, and gradually it became clear to her

that he was not in the library.



She turned back to the parlor-maid.



“Mr. Boyne must be up-stairs. Please tell him that luncheon is ready.”



The parlor-maid appeared to hesitate between the obvious duty of obeying

orders and an equally obvious conviction of the foolishness of

the injunction laid upon her. The struggle resulted in her saying

doubtfully, “If you please, Madam, Mr. Boyne’s not up-stairs.”



“Not in his room? Are you sure?”



“I’m sure, Madam.”



Mary consulted the clock. “Where is he, then?”



“He’s gone out,” Trimmle announced, with the superior air of one who has

respectfully waited for the question that a well-ordered mind would have

first propounded.



Mary’s previous conjecture had been right, then. Boyne must have gone to

the gardens to meet her, and since she had missed him, it was clear that

he had taken the shorter way by the south door, instead of going round

to the court. She crossed the hall to the glass portal opening directly

on the yew garden, but the parlor-maid, after another moment of inner

conflict, decided to bring out recklessly, “Please, Madam, Mr. Boyne

didn’t go that way.”



Mary turned back. “Where DID he go? And when?”



“He went out of the front door, up the drive, Madam.” It was a matter of

principle with Trimmle never to answer more than one question at a time.



“Up the drive? At this hour?” Mary went to the door herself, and

glanced across the court through the long tunnel of bare limes. But

its perspective was as empty as when she had scanned it on entering the

house.



“Did Mr. Boyne leave no message?” she asked.



Trimmle seemed to surrender herself to a last struggle with the forces

of chaos.



“No, Madam. He just went out with the gentleman.”



“The gentleman? What gentleman?” Mary wheeled about, as if to front this

new factor.



“The gentleman who called, Madam,” said Trimmle, resignedly.



“When did a gentleman call? Do explain yourself, Trimmle!”



Only the fact that Mary was very hungry, and that she wanted to consult

her husband about the greenhouses, would have caused her to lay so

unusual an injunction on her attendant; and even now she was detached

enough to note in Trimmle’s eye the dawning defiance of the respectful

subordinate who has been pressed too hard.



“I couldn’t exactly say the hour, Madam, because I didn’t let the

gentleman in,” she replied, with the air of magnanimously ignoring the

irregularity of her mistress’s course.



“You didn’t let him in?”



“No, Madam. When the bell rang I was dressing, and Agnes--”



“Go and ask Agnes, then,” Mary interjected. Trimmle still wore her

look of patient magnanimity. “Agnes would not know, Madam, for she had

unfortunately burnt her hand in trying the wick of the new lamp from

town--” Trimmle, as Mary was aware, had always been opposed to the new

lamp--“and so Mrs. Dockett sent the kitchen-maid instead.”



Mary looked again at the clock. “It’s after two! Go and ask the

kitchen-maid if Mr. Boyne left any word.”



She went into luncheon without waiting, and Trimmle presently brought

her there the kitchen-maid’s statement that the gentleman had called

about one o’clock, that Mr. Boyne had gone out with him without leaving

any message. The kitchen-maid did not even know the caller’s name, for

he had written it on a slip of paper, which he had folded and handed to

her, with the injunction to deliver it at once to Mr. Boyne.



Mary finished her luncheon, still wondering, and when it was over,

and Trimmle had brought the coffee to the drawing-room, her wonder had

deepened to a first faint tinge of disquietude. It was unlike Boyne

to absent himself without explanation at so unwonted an hour, and the

difficulty of identifying the visitor whose summons he had apparently

obeyed made his disappearance the more unaccountable. Mary Boyne’s

experience as the wife of a busy engineer, subject to sudden calls and

compelled to keep irregular hours, had trained her to the philosophic

acceptance of surprises; but since Boyne’s withdrawal from business he

had adopted a Benedictine regularity of life. As if to make up for the

dispersed and agitated years, with their “stand-up” lunches and dinners

rattled down to the joltings of the dining-car, he cultivated the last

refinements of punctuality and monotony, discouraging his wife’s fancy

for the unexpected; and declaring that to a delicate taste there were

infinite gradations of pleasure in the fixed recurrences of habit.



Still, since no life can completely defend itself from the unforeseen,

it was evident that all Boyne’s precautions would sooner or later prove

unavailable, and Mary concluded that he had cut short a tiresome visit

by walking with his caller to the station, or at least accompanying him

for part of the way.



This conclusion relieved her from farther preoccupation, and she went

out herself to take up her conference with the gardener. Thence she

walked to the village post-office, a mile or so away; and when she

turned toward home, the early twilight was setting in.



She had taken a foot-path across the downs, and as Boyne, meanwhile,

had probably returned from the station by the highroad, there was little

likelihood of their meeting on the way. She felt sure, however, of his

having reached the house before her; so sure that, when she entered it

herself, without even pausing to inquire of Trimmle, she made directly

for the library. But the library was still empty, and with an unwonted

precision of visual memory she immediately observed that the papers on

her husband’s desk lay precisely as they had lain when she had gone in

to call him to luncheon.



Then of a sudden she was seized by a vague dread of the unknown. She had

closed the door behind her on entering, and as she stood alone in the

long, silent, shadowy room, her dread seemed to take shape and sound,

to be there audibly breathing and lurking among the shadows. Her

short-sighted eyes strained through them, half-discerning an actual

presence, something aloof, that watched and knew; and in the recoil from

that intangible propinquity she threw herself suddenly on the bell-rope

and gave it a desperate pull.



The long, quavering summons brought Trimmle in precipitately with a

lamp, and Mary breathed again at this sobering reappearance of the

usual.



“You may bring tea if Mr. Boyne is in,” she said, to justify her ring.



“Very well, Madam. But Mr. Boyne is not in,” said Trimmle, putting down

the lamp.



“Not in? You mean he’s come back and gone out again?”



“No, Madam. He’s never been back.”



The dread stirred again, and Mary knew that now it had her fast.



“Not since he went out with--the gentleman?”



“Not since he went out with the gentleman.”



“But who WAS the gentleman?” Mary gasped out, with the sharp note of

some one trying to be heard through a confusion of meaningless noises.



“That I couldn’t say, Madam.” Trimmle, standing there by the lamp,

seemed suddenly to grow less round and rosy, as though eclipsed by the

same creeping shade of apprehension.



“But the kitchen-maid knows--wasn’t it the kitchen-maid who let him in?”



“She doesn’t know either, Madam, for he wrote his name on a folded

paper.”



Mary, through her agitation, was aware that they were both designating

the unknown visitor by a vague pronoun, instead of the conventional

formula which, till then, had kept their allusions within the bounds of

custom. And at the same moment her mind caught at the suggestion of the

folded paper.



“But he must have a name! Where is the paper?”



She moved to the desk, and began to turn over the scattered documents

that littered it. The first that caught her eye was an unfinished letter

in her husband’s hand, with his pen lying across it, as though dropped

there at a sudden summons.



“My dear Parvis,”--who was Parvis?--“I have just received your letter

announcing Elwell’s death, and while I suppose there is now no farther

risk of trouble, it might be safer--”



She tossed the sheet aside, and continued her search; but no folded

paper was discoverable among the letters and pages of manuscript which

had been swept together in a promiscuous heap, as if by a hurried or a

startled gesture.



“But the kitchen-maid SAW him. Send her here,” she commanded, wondering

at her dullness in not thinking sooner of so simple a solution.



Trimmle, at the behest, vanished in a flash, as if thankful to be out

of the room, and when she reappeared, conducting the agitated underling,

Mary had regained her self-possession, and had her questions pat.



The gentleman was a stranger, yes--that she understood. But what had he

said? And, above all, what had he looked like? The first question was

easily enough answered, for the disconcerting reason that he had said so

little--had merely asked for Mr. Boyne, and, scribbling something on a

bit of paper, had requested that it should at once be carried in to him.



“Then you don’t know what he wrote? You’re not sure it WAS his name?”



The kitchen-maid was not sure, but supposed it was, since he had written

it in answer to her inquiry as to whom she should announce.



“And when you carried the paper in to Mr. Boyne, what did he say?”



The kitchen-maid did not think that Mr. Boyne had said anything, but she

could not be sure, for just as she had handed him the paper and he was

opening it, she had become aware that the visitor had followed her

into the library, and she had slipped out, leaving the two gentlemen

together.



“But then, if you left them in the library, how do you know that they

went out of the house?”



This question plunged the witness into momentary inarticulateness,

from which she was rescued by Trimmle, who, by means of ingenious

circumlocutions, elicited the statement that before she could cross the

hall to the back passage she had heard the gentlemen behind her, and had

seen them go out of the front door together.



“Then, if you saw the gentleman twice, you must be able to tell me what

he looked like.”



But with this final challenge to her powers of expression it became

clear that the limit of the kitchen-maid’s endurance had been reached.

The obligation of going to the front door to “show in” a visitor was

in itself so subversive of the fundamental order of things that it had

thrown her faculties into hopeless disarray, and she could only stammer

out, after various panting efforts at evocation, “His hat, mum, was

different-like, as you might say--”



“Different? How different?” Mary flashed out at her, her own mind, in

the same instant, leaping back to an image left on it that morning, but

temporarily lost under layers of subsequent impressions.



“His hat had a wide brim, you mean? and his face was pale--a youngish

face?” Mary pressed her, with a white-lipped intensity of interrogation.

But if the kitchen-maid found any adequate answer to this challenge,

it was swept away for her listener down the rushing current of her own

convictions. The stranger--the stranger in the garden! Why had Mary not

thought of him before? She needed no one now to tell her that it was he

who had called for her husband and gone away with him. But who was he,

and why had Boyne obeyed his call?









IV





It leaped out at her suddenly, like a grin out of the dark, that they

had often called England so little--“such a confoundedly hard place to

get lost in.”



A CONFOUNDEDLY HARD PLACE TO GET LOST IN! That had been her husband’s

phrase. And now, with the whole machinery of official investigation

sweeping its flash-lights from shore to shore, and across the dividing

straits; now, with Boyne’s name blazing from the walls of every town

and village, his portrait (how that wrung her!) hawked up and down the

country like the image of a hunted criminal; now the little compact,

populous island, so policed, surveyed, and administered, revealed itself

as a Sphinx-like guardian of abysmal mysteries, staring back into his

wife’s anguished eyes as if with the malicious joy of knowing something

they would never know!



In the fortnight since Boyne’s disappearance there had been no word of

him, no trace of his movements. Even the usual misleading reports that

raise expectancy in tortured bosoms had been few and fleeting. No one

but the bewildered kitchen-maid had seen him leave the house, and no one

else had seen “the gentleman” who accompanied him. All inquiries in the

neighborhood failed to elicit the memory of a stranger’s presence that

day in the neighborhood of Lyng. And no one had met Edward Boyne, either

alone or in company, in any of the neighboring villages, or on the road

across the downs, or at either of the local railway-stations. The sunny

English noon had swallowed him as completely as if he had gone out into

Cimmerian night.



Mary, while every external means of investigation was working at its

highest pressure, had ransacked her husband’s papers for any trace of

antecedent complications, of entanglements or obligations unknown to

her, that might throw a faint ray into the darkness. But if any such

had existed in the background of Boyne’s life, they had disappeared as

completely as the slip of paper on which the visitor had written his

name. There remained no possible thread of guidance except--if it were

indeed an exception--the letter which Boyne had apparently been in the

act of writing when he received his mysterious summons. That letter,

read and reread by his wife, and submitted by her to the police, yielded

little enough for conjecture to feed on.



“I have just heard of Elwell’s death, and while I suppose there is now

no farther risk of trouble, it might be safer--” That was all. The “risk

of trouble” was easily explained by the newspaper clipping which had

apprised Mary of the suit brought against her husband by one of his

associates in the Blue Star enterprise. The only new information

conveyed in the letter was the fact of its showing Boyne, when he wrote

it, to be still apprehensive of the results of the suit, though he

had assured his wife that it had been withdrawn, and though the letter

itself declared that the plaintiff was dead. It took several weeks

of exhaustive cabling to fix the identity of the “Parvis” to whom the

fragmentary communication was addressed, but even after these inquiries

had shown him to be a Waukesha lawyer, no new facts concerning the

Elwell suit were elicited. He appeared to have had no direct concern

in it, but to have been conversant with the facts merely as an

acquaintance, and possible intermediary; and he declared himself unable

to divine with what object Boyne intended to seek his assistance.



This negative information, sole fruit of the first fortnight’s feverish

search, was not increased by a jot during the slow weeks that followed.

Mary knew that the investigations were still being carried on, but she

had a vague sense of their gradually slackening, as the actual march of

time seemed to slacken. It was as though the days, flying horror-struck

from the shrouded image of the one inscrutable day, gained assurance as

the distance lengthened, till at last they fell back into their normal

gait. And so with the human imaginations at work on the dark event. No

doubt it occupied them still, but week by week and hour by hour it grew

less absorbing, took up less space, was slowly but inevitably crowded

out of the foreground of consciousness by the new problems perpetually

bubbling up from the vaporous caldron of human experience.



Even Mary Boyne’s consciousness gradually felt the same lowering of

velocity. It still swayed with the incessant oscillations of conjecture;

but they were slower, more rhythmical in their beat. There were moments

of overwhelming lassitude when, like the victim of some poison which

leaves the brain clear, but holds the body motionless, she saw herself

domesticated with the Horror, accepting its perpetual presence as one of

the fixed conditions of life.



These moments lengthened into hours and days, till she passed into a

phase of stolid acquiescence. She watched the familiar routine of life

with the incurious eye of a savage on whom the meaningless processes of

civilization make but the faintest impression. She had come to regard

herself as part of the routine, a spoke of the wheel, revolving with its

motion; she felt almost like the furniture of the room in which she sat,

an insensate object to be dusted and pushed about with the chairs and

tables. And this deepening apathy held her fast at Lyng, in spite of

the urgent entreaties of friends and the usual medical recommendation of

“change.” Her friends supposed that her refusal to move was inspired by

the belief that her husband would one day return to the spot from which

he had vanished, and a beautiful legend grew up about this imaginary

state of waiting. But in reality she had no such belief: the depths of

anguish inclosing her were no longer lighted by flashes of hope. She was

sure that Boyne would never come back, that he had gone out of her sight

as completely as if Death itself had waited that day on the threshold.

She had even renounced, one by one, the various theories as to his

disappearance which had been advanced by the press, the police, and her

own agonized imagination. In sheer lassitude her mind turned from these

alternatives of horror, and sank back into the blank fact that he was

gone.



No, she would never know what had become of him--no one would ever know.

But the house KNEW; the library in which she spent her long, lonely

evenings knew. For it was here that the last scene had been enacted,

here that the stranger had come, and spoken the word which had caused

Boyne to rise and follow him. The floor she trod had felt his tread; the

books on the shelves had seen his face; and there were moments when the

intense consciousness of the old, dusky walls seemed about to break out

into some audible revelation of their secret. But the revelation

never came, and she knew it would never come. Lyng was not one of the

garrulous old houses that betray the secrets intrusted to them. Its

very legend proved that it had always been the mute accomplice, the

incorruptible custodian of the mysteries it had surprised. And Mary

Boyne, sitting face to face with its portentous silence, felt the

futility of seeking to break it by any human means.









V





“I don’t say it WASN’T straight, yet don’t say it WAS straight. It was

business.”



Mary, at the words, lifted her head with a start, and looked intently at

the speaker.



When, half an hour before, a card with “Mr. Parvis” on it had been

brought up to her, she had been immediately aware that the name had been

a part of her consciousness ever since she had read it at the head of

Boyne’s unfinished letter. In the library she had found awaiting her a

small neutral-tinted man with a bald head and gold eye-glasses, and it

sent a strange tremor through her to know that this was the person to

whom her husband’s last known thought had been directed.



Parvis, civilly, but without vain preamble,--in the manner of a man who

has his watch in his hand,--had set forth the object of his visit.

He had “run over” to England on business, and finding himself in the

neighborhood of Dorchester, had not wished to leave it without paying

his respects to Mrs. Boyne; without asking her, if the occasion offered,

what she meant to do about Bob Elwell’s family.



The words touched the spring of some obscure dread in Mary’s bosom.

Did her visitor, after all, know what Boyne had meant by his unfinished

phrase? She asked for an elucidation of his question, and noticed at

once that he seemed surprised at her continued ignorance of the subject.

Was it possible that she really knew as little as she said?



“I know nothing--you must tell me,” she faltered out; and her visitor

thereupon proceeded to unfold his story. It threw, even to her confused

perceptions, and imperfectly initiated vision, a lurid glare on the

whole hazy episode of the Blue Star Mine. Her husband had made his money

in that brilliant speculation at the cost of “getting ahead” of some one

less alert to seize the chance; the victim of his ingenuity was young

Robert Elwell, who had “put him on” to the Blue Star scheme.



Parvis, at Mary’s first startled cry, had thrown her a sobering glance

through his impartial glasses.



“Bob Elwell wasn’t smart enough, that’s all; if he had been, he might

have turned round and served Boyne the same way. It’s the kind of thing

that happens every day in business. I guess it’s what the scientists

call the survival of the fittest,” said Mr. Parvis, evidently pleased

with the aptness of his analogy.



Mary felt a physical shrinking from the next question she tried to

frame; it was as though the words on her lips had a taste that nauseated

her.



“But then--you accuse my husband of doing something dishonorable?”



Mr. Parvis surveyed the question dispassionately. “Oh, no, I don’t.

I don’t even say it wasn’t straight.” He glanced up and down the long

lines of books, as if one of them might have supplied him with the

definition he sought. “I don’t say it WASN’T straight, and yet I don’t

say it WAS straight. It was business.” After all, no definition in his

category could be more comprehensive than that.



Mary sat staring at him with a look of terror. He seemed to her like the

indifferent, implacable emissary of some dark, formless power.



“But Mr. Elwell’s lawyers apparently did not take your view, since I

suppose the suit was withdrawn by their advice.”



“Oh, yes, they knew he hadn’t a leg to stand on, technically. It was

when they advised him to withdraw the suit that he got desperate. You

see, he’d borrowed most of the money he lost in the Blue Star, and he

was up a tree. That’s why he shot himself when they told him he had no

show.”



The horror was sweeping over Mary in great, deafening waves.



“He shot himself? He killed himself because of THAT?”



“Well, he didn’t kill himself, exactly. He dragged on two months before

he died.” Parvis emitted the statement as unemotionally as a gramophone

grinding out its “record.”



“You mean that he tried to kill himself, and failed? And tried again?”



“Oh, he didn’t have to try again,” said Parvis, grimly.



They sat opposite each other in silence, he swinging his eye-glass

thoughtfully about his finger, she, motionless, her arms stretched along

her knees in an attitude of rigid tension.



“But if you knew all this,” she began at length, hardly able to force

her voice above a whisper, “how is it that when I wrote you at the

time of my husband’s disappearance you said you didn’t understand his

letter?”



Parvis received this without perceptible discomfiture. “Why, I didn’t

understand it--strictly speaking. And it wasn’t the time to talk

about it, if I had. The Elwell business was settled when the suit was

withdrawn. Nothing I could have told you would have helped you to find

your husband.”



Mary continued to scrutinize him. “Then why are you telling me now?”



Still Parvis did not hesitate. “Well, to begin with, I supposed you

knew more than you appear to--I mean about the circumstances of Elwell’s

death. And then people are talking of it now; the whole matter’s been

raked up again. And I thought, if you didn’t know, you ought to.”



She remained silent, and he continued: “You see, it’s only come out

lately what a bad state Elwell’s affairs were in. His wife’s a proud

woman, and she fought on as long as she could, going out to work, and

taking sewing at home, when she got too sick--something with the heart,

I believe. But she had his bedridden mother to look after, and the

children, and she broke down under it, and finally had to ask for help.

That attracted attention to the case, and the papers took it up, and a

subscription was started. Everybody out there liked Bob Elwell, and most

of the prominent names in the place are down on the list, and people

began to wonder why--”



Parvis broke off to fumble in an inner pocket. “Here,” he continued,

“here’s an account of the whole thing from the ‘Sentinel’--a little

sensational, of course. But I guess you’d better look it over.”



He held out a newspaper to Mary, who unfolded it slowly, remembering,

as she did so, the evening when, in that same room, the perusal of

a clipping from the “Sentinel” had first shaken the depths of her

security.



As she opened the paper, her eyes, shrinking from the glaring

head-lines, “Widow of Boyne’s Victim Forced to Appeal for Aid,” ran down

the column of text to two portraits inserted in it. The first was

her husband’s, taken from a photograph made the year they had come to

England. It was the picture of him that she liked best, the one that

stood on the writing-table up-stairs in her bedroom. As the eyes in the

photograph met hers, she felt it would be impossible to read what was

said of him, and closed her lids with the sharpness of the pain.



“I thought if you felt disposed to put your name down--” she heard

Parvis continue.



She opened her eyes with an effort, and they fell on the other portrait.

It was that of a youngish man, slightly built, in rough clothes, with

features somewhat blurred by the shadow of a projecting hat-brim. Where

had she seen that outline before? She stared at it confusedly, her heart

hammering in her throat and ears. Then she gave a cry.



“This is the man--the man who came for my husband!”



She heard Parvis start to his feet, and was dimly aware that she had

slipped backward into the corner of the sofa, and that he was bending

above her in alarm. With an intense effort she straightened herself, and

reached out for the paper, which she had dropped.



“It’s the man! I should know him anywhere!” she cried in a voice that

sounded in her own ears like a scream.



Parvis’s voice seemed to come to her from far off, down endless,

fog-muffled windings.



“Mrs. Boyne, you’re not very well. Shall I call somebody? Shall I get a

glass of water?”



“No, no, no!” She threw herself toward him, her hand frantically

clenching the newspaper. “I tell you, it’s the man! I KNOW him! He spoke

to me in the garden!”



Parvis took the journal from her, directing his glasses to the portrait.

“It can’t be, Mrs. Boyne. It’s Robert Elwell.”



“Robert Elwell?” Her white stare seemed to travel into space. “Then it

was Robert Elwell who came for him.”



“Came for Boyne? The day he went away?” Parvis’s voice dropped as hers

rose. He bent over, laying a fraternal hand on her, as if to coax her

gently back into her seat. “Why, Elwell was dead! Don’t you remember?”



Mary sat with her eyes fixed on the picture, unconscious of what he was

saying.



“Don’t you remember Boyne’s unfinished letter to me--the one you found

on his desk that day? It was written just after he’d heard of Elwell’s

death.” She noticed an odd shake in Parvis’s unemotional voice. “Surely

you remember that!” he urged her.



Yes, she remembered: that was the profoundest horror of it. Elwell had

died the day before her husband’s disappearance; and this was Elwell’s

portrait; and it was the portrait of the man who had spoken to her in

the garden. She lifted her head and looked slowly about the library. The

library could have borne witness that it was also the portrait of the

man who had come in that day to call Boyne from his unfinished letter.

Through the misty surgings of her brain she heard the faint boom

of half-forgotten words--words spoken by Alida Stair on the lawn at

Pangbourne before Boyne and his wife had ever seen the house at Lyng, or

had imagined that they might one day live there.



“This was the man who spoke to me,” she repeated.



She looked again at Parvis. He was trying to conceal his disturbance

under what he imagined to be an expression of indulgent commiseration;

but the edges of his lips were blue. “He thinks me mad; but I’m not

mad,” she reflected; and suddenly there flashed upon her a way of

justifying her strange affirmation.



She sat quiet, controlling the quiver of her lips, and waiting till she

could trust her voice to keep its habitual level; then she said, looking

straight at Parvis: “Will you answer me one question, please? When was

it that Robert Elwell tried to kill himself?”



“When--when?” Parvis stammered.



“Yes; the date. Please try to remember.”



She saw that he was growing still more afraid of her. “I have a reason,”

 she insisted gently.



“Yes, yes. Only I can’t remember. About two months before, I should

say.”



“I want the date,” she repeated.



Parvis picked up the newspaper. “We might see here,” he said, still

humoring her. He ran his eyes down the page. “Here it is. Last

October--the--”



She caught the words from him. “The 20th, wasn’t it?” With a sharp look

at her, he verified. “Yes, the 20th. Then you DID know?”



“I know now.” Her white stare continued to travel past him. “Sunday, the

20th--that was the day he came first.”



Parvis’s voice was almost inaudible. “Came HERE first?”



“Yes.”



“You saw him twice, then?”



“Yes, twice.” She breathed it at him with dilated eyes. “He came first

on the 20th of October. I remember the date because it was the day

we went up Meldon Steep for the first time.” She felt a faint gasp

of inward laughter at the thought that but for that she might have

forgotten.



Parvis continued to scrutinize her, as if trying to intercept her gaze.



“We saw him from the roof,” she went on. “He came down the lime-avenue

toward the house. He was dressed just as he is in that picture. My

husband saw him first. He was frightened, and ran down ahead of me; but

there was no one there. He had vanished.”



“Elwell had vanished?” Parvis faltered.



“Yes.” Their two whispers seemed to grope for each other. “I couldn’t

think what had happened. I see now. He TRIED to come then; but he wasn’t

dead enough--he couldn’t reach us. He had to wait for two months; and

then he came back again--and Ned went with him.”



She nodded at Parvis with the look of triumph of a child who has

successfully worked out a difficult puzzle. But suddenly she lifted her

hands with a desperate gesture, pressing them to her bursting temples.



“Oh, my God! I sent him to Ned--I told him where to go! I sent him to

this room!” she screamed out.



She felt the walls of the room rush toward her, like inward falling

ruins; and she heard Parvis, a long way off, as if through the ruins,

crying to her, and struggling to get at her. But she was numb to his

touch, she did not know what he was saying. Through the tumult she heard

but one clear note, the voice of Alida Stair, speaking on the lawn at

Pangbourne.



“You won’t know till afterward,” it said. “You won’t know till long,

long afterward.”





The End of Afterward











THE FULNESS OF LIFE



December 1893









I.





For hours she had lain in a kind of gentle torpor, not unlike that sweet

lassitude which masters one in the hush of a midsummer noon, when the

heat seems to have silenced the very birds and insects, and, lying sunk

in the tasselled meadow-grasses, one looks up through a level roofing

of maple-leaves at the vast shadowless, and unsuggestive blue. Now and

then, at ever-lengthening intervals, a flash of pain darted through her,

like the ripple of sheet-lightning across such a midsummer sky; but it

was too transitory to shake her stupor, that calm, delicious, bottomless

stupor into which she felt herself sinking more and more deeply, without

a disturbing impulse of resistance, an effort of reattachment to the

vanishing edges of consciousness.



The resistance, the effort, had known their hour of violence; but

now they were at an end. Through her mind, long harried by grotesque

visions, fragmentary images of the life that she was leaving, tormenting

lines of verse, obstinate presentments of pictures once beheld,

indistinct impressions of rivers, towers, and cupolas, gathered in the

length of journeys half forgotten--through her mind there now only moved

a few primal sensations of colorless well-being; a vague satisfaction

in the thought that she had swallowed her noxious last draught of

medicine... and that she should never again hear the creaking of her

husband’s boots--those horrible boots--and that no one would come to

bother her about the next day’s dinner... or the butcher’s book....



At last even these dim sensations spent themselves in the thickening

obscurity which enveloped her; a dusk now filled with pale geometric

roses, circling softly, interminably before her, now darkened to a

uniform blue-blackness, the hue of a summer night without stars. And

into this darkness she felt herself sinking, sinking, with the gentle

sense of security of one upheld from beneath. Like a tepid tide it

rose around her, gliding ever higher and higher, folding in its velvety

embrace her relaxed and tired body, now submerging her breast and

shoulders, now creeping gradually, with soft inexorableness, over her

throat to her chin, to her ears, to her mouth.... Ah, now it was rising

too high; the impulse to struggle was renewed;... her mouth was full;...

she was choking.... Help!



“It is all over,” said the nurse, drawing down the eyelids with official

composure.



The clock struck three. They remembered it afterward. Someone opened the

window and let in a blast of that strange, neutral air which walks

the earth between darkness and dawn; someone else led the husband into

another room. He walked vaguely, like a blind man, on his creaking

boots.









II.





She stood, as it seemed, on a threshold, yet no tangible gateway was in

front of her. Only a wide vista of light, mild yet penetrating as the

gathered glimmer of innumerable stars, expanded gradually before her

eyes, in blissful contrast to the cavernous darkness from which she had

of late emerged.



She stepped forward, not frightened, but hesitating, and as her eyes

began to grow more familiar with the melting depths of light about her,

she distinguished the outlines of a landscape, at first swimming in

the opaline uncertainty of Shelley’s vaporous creations, then gradually

resolved into distincter shape--the vast unrolling of a sunlit plain,

aerial forms of mountains, and presently the silver crescent of a

river in the valley, and a blue stencilling of trees along its

curve--something suggestive in its ineffable hue of an azure background

of Leonardo’s, strange, enchanting, mysterious, leading on the eye and

the imagination into regions of fabulous delight. As she gazed, her

heart beat with a soft and rapturous surprise; so exquisite a promise

she read in the summons of that hyaline distance.



“And so death is not the end after all,” in sheer gladness she heard

herself exclaiming aloud. “I always knew that it couldn’t be. I believed

in Darwin, of course. I do still; but then Darwin himself said that he

wasn’t sure about the soul--at least, I think he did--and Wallace was a

spiritualist; and then there was St. George Mivart--”



Her gaze lost itself in the ethereal remoteness of the mountains.



“How beautiful! How satisfying!” she murmured. “Perhaps now I shall

really know what it is to live.”



As she spoke she felt a sudden thickening of her heart-beats, and

looking up she was aware that before her stood the Spirit of Life.



“Have you never really known what it is to live?” the Spirit of Life

asked her.



“I have never known,” she replied, “that fulness of life which we all

feel ourselves capable of knowing; though my life has not been without

scattered hints of it, like the scent of earth which comes to one

sometimes far out at sea.”



“And what do you call the fulness of life?” the Spirit asked again.



“Oh, I can’t tell you, if you don’t know,” she said, almost

reproachfully. “Many words are supposed to define it--love and sympathy

are those in commonest use, but I am not even sure that they are the

right ones, and so few people really know what they mean.”



“You were married,” said the Spirit, “yet you did not find the fulness

of life in your marriage?”



“Oh, dear, no,” she replied, with an indulgent scorn, “my marriage was a

very incomplete affair.”



“And yet you were fond of your husband?”



“You have hit upon the exact word; I was fond of him, yes, just as I

was fond of my grandmother, and the house that I was born in, and my old

nurse. Oh, I was fond of him, and we were counted a very happy couple.

But I have sometimes thought that a woman’s nature is like a great house

full of rooms: there is the hall, through which everyone passes in going

in and out; the drawing-room, where one receives formal visits; the

sitting-room, where the members of the family come and go as they list;

but beyond that, far beyond, are other rooms, the handles of whose doors

perhaps are never turned; no one knows the way to them, no one knows

whither they lead; and in the innermost room, the holy of holies, the

soul sits alone and waits for a footstep that never comes.”



“And your husband,” asked the Spirit, after a pause, “never got beyond

the family sitting-room?”



“Never,” she returned, impatiently; “and the worst of it was that he was

quite content to remain there. He thought it perfectly beautiful, and

sometimes, when he was admiring its commonplace furniture, insignificant

as the chairs and tables of a hotel parlor, I felt like crying out to

him: ‘Fool, will you never guess that close at hand are rooms full of

treasures and wonders, such as the eye of man hath not seen, rooms that

no step has crossed, but that might be yours to live in, could you but

find the handle of the door?’”



“Then,” the Spirit continued, “those moments of which you lately spoke,

which seemed to come to you like scattered hints of the fulness of life,

were not shared with your husband?”



“Oh, no--never. He was different. His boots creaked, and he always

slammed the door when he went out, and he never read anything but

railway novels and the sporting advertisements in the papers--and--and,

in short, we never understood each other in the least.”



“To what influence, then, did you owe those exquisite sensations?”



“I can hardly tell. Sometimes to the perfume of a flower; sometimes to a

verse of Dante or of Shakespeare; sometimes to a picture or a sunset,

or to one of those calm days at sea, when one seems to be lying in

the hollow of a blue pearl; sometimes, but rarely, to a word spoken by

someone who chanced to give utterance, at the right moment, to what I

felt but could not express.”



“Someone whom you loved?” asked the Spirit.



“I never loved anyone, in that way,” she said, rather sadly, “nor was

I thinking of any one person when I spoke, but of two or three who, by

touching for an instant upon a certain chord of my being, had called

forth a single note of that strange melody which seemed sleeping in my

soul. It has seldom happened, however, that I have owed such feelings to

people; and no one ever gave me a moment of such happiness as it was my

lot to feel one evening in the Church of Or San Michele, in Florence.”



“Tell me about it,” said the Spirit.



“It was near sunset on a rainy spring afternoon in Easter week. The

clouds had vanished, dispersed by a sudden wind, and as we entered the

church the fiery panes of the high windows shone out like lamps through

the dusk. A priest was at the high altar, his white cope a livid spot in

the incense-laden obscurity, the light of the candles flickering up and

down like fireflies about his head; a few people knelt near by. We stole

behind them and sat down on a bench close to the tabernacle of Orcagna.



“Strange to say, though Florence was not new to me, I had never been in

the church before; and in that magical light I saw for the first time

the inlaid steps, the fluted columns, the sculptured bas-reliefs and

canopy of the marvellous shrine. The marble, worn and mellowed by the

subtle hand of time, took on an unspeakable rosy hue, suggestive in

some remote way of the honey-colored columns of the Parthenon, but more

mystic, more complex, a color not born of the sun’s inveterate kiss,

but made up of cryptal twilight, and the flame of candles upon martyrs’

tombs, and gleams of sunset through symbolic panes of chrysoprase and

ruby; such a light as illumines the missals in the library of Siena,

or burns like a hidden fire through the Madonna of Gian Bellini in the

Church of the Redeemer, at Venice; the light of the Middle Ages, richer,

more solemn, more significant than the limpid sunshine of Greece.



“The church was silent, but for the wail of the priest and the

occasional scraping of a chair against the floor, and as I sat there,

bathed in that light, absorbed in rapt contemplation of the marble

miracle which rose before me, cunningly wrought as a casket of ivory and

enriched with jewel-like incrustations and tarnished gleams of gold, I

felt myself borne onward along a mighty current, whose source seemed to

be in the very beginning of things, and whose tremendous waters gathered

as they went all the mingled streams of human passion and endeavor.

Life in all its varied manifestations of beauty and strangeness seemed

weaving a rhythmical dance around me as I moved, and wherever the spirit

of man had passed I knew that my foot had once been familiar.



“As I gazed the mediaeval bosses of the tabernacle of Orcagna seemed to

melt and flow into their primal forms so that the folded lotus of

the Nile and the Greek acanthus were braided with the runic knots and

fish-tailed monsters of the North, and all the plastic terror and beauty

born of man’s hand from the Ganges to the Baltic quivered and mingled

in Orcagna’s apotheosis of Mary. And so the river bore me on, past the

alien face of antique civilizations and the familiar wonders of Greece,

till I swam upon the fiercely rushing tide of the Middle Ages, with its

swirling eddies of passion, its heaven-reflecting pools of poetry

and art; I heard the rhythmic blow of the craftsmen’s hammers in the

goldsmiths’ workshops and on the walls of churches, the party-cries of

armed factions in the narrow streets, the organ-roll of Dante’s verse,

the crackle of the fagots around Arnold of Brescia, the twitter of

the swallows to which St. Francis preached, the laughter of the

ladies listening on the hillside to the quips of the Decameron, while

plague-struck Florence howled beneath them--all this and much more I

heard, joined in strange unison with voices earlier and more remote,

fierce, passionate, or tender, yet subdued to such awful harmony that

I thought of the song that the morning stars sang together and felt as

though it were sounding in my ears. My heart beat to suffocation, the

tears burned my lids, the joy, the mystery of it seemed too intolerable

to be borne. I could not understand even then the words of the song; but

I knew that if there had been someone at my side who could have heard it

with me, we might have found the key to it together.



“I turned to my husband, who was sitting beside me in an attitude of

patient dejection, gazing into the bottom of his hat; but at that moment

he rose, and stretching his stiffened legs, said, mildly: ‘Hadn’t we

better be going? There doesn’t seem to be much to see here, and you know

the table d’hote dinner is at half-past six o’clock.”





Her recital ended, there was an interval of silence; then the Spirit of

Life said: “There is a compensation in store for such needs as you have

expressed.”



“Oh, then you DO understand?” she exclaimed. “Tell me what compensation,

I entreat you!”



“It is ordained,” the Spirit answered, “that every soul which seeks

in vain on earth for a kindred soul to whom it can lay bare its inmost

being shall find that soul here and be united to it for eternity.”



A glad cry broke from her lips. “Ah, shall I find him at last?” she

cried, exultant.



“He is here,” said the Spirit of Life.



She looked up and saw that a man stood near whose soul (for in that

unwonted light she seemed to see his soul more clearly than his face)

drew her toward him with an invincible force.



“Are you really he?” she murmured.



“I am he,” he answered.



She laid her hand in his and drew him toward the parapet which overhung

the valley.



“Shall we go down together,” she asked him, “into that marvellous

country; shall we see it together, as if with the self-same eyes, and

tell each other in the same words all that we think and feel?”



“So,” he replied, “have I hoped and dreamed.”



“What?” she asked, with rising joy. “Then you, too, have looked for me?”



“All my life.”



“How wonderful! And did you never, never find anyone in the other world

who understood you?”



“Not wholly--not as you and I understand each other.”



“Then you feel it, too? Oh, I am happy,” she sighed.



They stood, hand in hand, looking down over the parapet upon the

shimmering landscape which stretched forth beneath them into sapphirine

space, and the Spirit of Life, who kept watch near the threshold, heard

now and then a floating fragment of their talk blown backward like the

stray swallows which the wind sometimes separates from their migratory

tribe.



“Did you never feel at sunset--”



“Ah, yes; but I never heard anyone else say so. Did you?”



“Do you remember that line in the third canto of the ‘Inferno?’”



“Ah, that line--my favorite always. Is it possible--”



“You know the stooping Victory in the frieze of the Nike Apteros?”



“You mean the one who is tying her sandal? Then you have noticed, too,

that all Botticelli and Mantegna are dormant in those flying folds of

her drapery?”



“After a storm in autumn have you never seen--”



“Yes, it is curious how certain flowers suggest certain painters--the

perfume of the incarnation, Leonardo; that of the rose, Titian; the

tuberose, Crivelli--”



“I never supposed that anyone else had noticed it.”



“Have you never thought--”



“Oh, yes, often and often; but I never dreamed that anyone else had.”



“But surely you must have felt--”



“Oh, yes, yes; and you, too--”



“How beautiful! How strange--”



Their voices rose and fell, like the murmur of two fountains answering

each other across a garden full of flowers. At length, with a certain

tender impatience, he turned to her and said: “Love, why should we

linger here? All eternity lies before us. Let us go down into that

beautiful country together and make a home for ourselves on some blue

hill above the shining river.”



As he spoke, the hand she had forgotten in his was suddenly withdrawn,

and he felt that a cloud was passing over the radiance of her soul.



“A home,” she repeated, slowly, “a home for you and me to live in for

all eternity?”



“Why not, love? Am I not the soul that yours has sought?”



“Y-yes--yes, I know--but, don’t you see, home would not be like home to

me, unless--”



“Unless?” he wonderingly repeated.



She did not answer, but she thought to herself, with an impulse of

whimsical inconsistency, “Unless you slammed the door and wore creaking

boots.”



But he had recovered his hold upon her hand, and by imperceptible

degrees was leading her toward the shining steps which descended to the

valley.



“Come, O my soul’s soul,” he passionately implored; “why delay a moment?

Surely you feel, as I do, that eternity itself is too short to hold such

bliss as ours. It seems to me that I can see our home already. Have

I not always seem it in my dreams? It is white, love, is it not, with

polished columns, and a sculptured cornice against the blue? Groves

of laurel and oleander and thickets of roses surround it; but from the

terrace where we walk at sunset, the eye looks out over woodlands and

cool meadows where, deep-bowered under ancient boughs, a stream goes

delicately toward the river. Indoors our favorite pictures hang upon the

walls and the rooms are lined with books. Think, dear, at last we shall

have time to read them all. With which shall we begin? Come, help me to

choose. Shall it be ‘Faust’ or the ‘Vita Nuova,’ the ‘Tempest’ or ‘Les

Caprices de Marianne,’ or the thirty-first canto of the ‘Paradise,’ or

‘Epipsychidion’ or ‘Lycidas’? Tell me, dear, which one?”



As he spoke he saw the answer trembling joyously upon her lips; but it

died in the ensuing silence, and she stood motionless, resisting the

persuasion of his hand.



“What is it?” he entreated.



“Wait a moment,” she said, with a strange hesitation in her voice. “Tell

me first, are you quite sure of yourself? Is there no one on earth whom

you sometimes remember?”



“Not since I have seen you,” he replied; for, being a man, he had indeed

forgotten.



Still she stood motionless, and he saw that the shadow deepened on her

soul.



“Surely, love,” he rebuked her, “it was not that which troubled you? For

my part I have walked through Lethe. The past has melted like a cloud

before the moon. I never lived until I saw you.”



She made no answer to his pleadings, but at length, rousing herself with

a visible effort, she turned away from him and moved toward the Spirit

of Life, who still stood near the threshold.



“I want to ask you a question,” she said, in a troubled voice.



“Ask,” said the Spirit.



“A little while ago,” she began, slowly, “you told me that every soul

which has not found a kindred soul on earth is destined to find one

here.”



“And have you not found one?” asked the Spirit.



“Yes; but will it be so with my husband’s soul also?”



“No,” answered the Spirit of Life, “for your husband imagined that

he had found his soul’s mate on earth in you; and for such delusions

eternity itself contains no cure.”



She gave a little cry. Was it of disappointment or triumph?



“Then--then what will happen to him when he comes here?”



“That I cannot tell you. Some field of activity and happiness he will

doubtless find, in due measure to his capacity for being active and

happy.”



She interrupted, almost angrily: “He will never be happy without me.”



“Do not be too sure of that,” said the Spirit.



She took no notice of this, and the Spirit continued: “He will not

understand you here any better than he did on earth.”



“No matter,” she said; “I shall be the only sufferer, for he always

thought that he understood me.”



“His boots will creak just as much as ever--”



“No matter.”



“And he will slam the door--”



“Very likely.”



“And continue to read railway novels--”



She interposed, impatiently: “Many men do worse than that.”



“But you said just now,” said the Spirit, “that you did not love him.”



“True,” she answered, simply; “but don’t you understand that I shouldn’t

feel at home without him? It is all very well for a week or two--but for

eternity! After all, I never minded the creaking of his boots, except

when my head ached, and I don’t suppose it will ache HERE; and he

was always so sorry when he had slammed the door, only he never COULD

remember not to. Besides, no one else would know how to look after him,

he is so helpless. His inkstand would never be filled, and he would

always be out of stamps and visiting-cards. He would never remember to

have his umbrella re-covered, or to ask the price of anything before he

bought it. Why, he wouldn’t even know what novels to read. I always had

to choose the kind he liked, with a murder or a forgery and a successful

detective.”



She turned abruptly to her kindred soul, who stood listening with a mien

of wonder and dismay.



“Don’t you see,” she said, “that I can’t possibly go with you?”



“But what do you intend to do?” asked the Spirit of Life.



“What do I intend to do?” she returned, indignantly. “Why, I mean to

wait for my husband, of course. If he had come here first HE would have

waited for me for years and years; and it would break his heart not to

find me here when he comes.” She pointed with a contemptuous gesture

to the magic vision of hill and vale sloping away to the translucent

mountains. “He wouldn’t give a fig for all that,” she said, “if he

didn’t find me here.”



“But consider,” warned the Spirit, “that you are now choosing for

eternity. It is a solemn moment.”



“Choosing!” she said, with a half-sad smile. “Do you still keep up here

that old fiction about choosing? I should have thought that YOU knew

better than that. How can I help myself? He will expect to find me here

when he comes, and he would never believe you if you told him that I had

gone away with someone else--never, never.”



“So be it,” said the Spirit. “Here, as on earth, each one must decide

for himself.”



She turned to her kindred soul and looked at him gently, almost

wistfully. “I am sorry,” she said. “I should have liked to talk with

you again; but you will understand, I know, and I dare say you will find

someone else a great deal cleverer--”



And without pausing to hear his answer she waved him a swift farewell

and turned back toward the threshold.



“Will my husband come soon?” she asked the Spirit of Life.



“That you are not destined to know,” the Spirit replied.



“No matter,” she said, cheerfully; “I have all eternity to wait in.”



And still seated alone on the threshold, she listens for the creaking of

his boots.





The End of The Fulness of Life











A VENETIAN NIGHT’S ENTERTAINMENT



December 1903







This is the story that, in the dining-room of the old Beacon Street

house (now the Aldebaran Club), Judge Anthony Bracknell, of the famous

East India firm of Bracknell & Saulsbee, when the ladies had withdrawn

to the oval parlour (and Maria’s harp was throwing its gauzy web of

sound across the Common), used to relate to his grandsons, about the

year that Buonaparte marched upon Moscow.









I





“Him Venice!” said the Lascar with the big earrings; and Tony Bracknell,

leaning on the high gunwale of his father’s East Indiaman, the Hepzibah

B., saw far off, across the morning sea, a faint vision of towers and

domes dissolved in golden air.



It was a rare February day of the year 1760, and a young Tony, newly

of age, and bound on the grand tour aboard the crack merchantman of old

Bracknell’s fleet, felt his heart leap up as the distant city trembled

into shape. VENICE! The name, since childhood, had been a magician’s

wand to him. In the hall of the old Bracknell house at Salem there hung

a series of yellowing prints which Uncle Richard Saulsbee had brought

home from one of his long voyages: views of heathen mosques and palaces,

of the Grand Turk’s Seraglio, of St. Peter’s Church in Rome; and, in

a corner--the corner nearest the rack where the old flintlocks hung--a

busy merry populous scene, entitled: ST. MARK’S SQUARE IN VENICE. This

picture, from the first, had singularly taken little Tony’s fancy. His

unformulated criticism on the others was that they lacked action.

True, in the view of St. Peter’s an experienced-looking gentleman in

a full-bottomed wig was pointing out the fairly obvious monument to a

bashful companion, who had presumably not ventured to raise his eyes to

it; while, at the doors of the Seraglio, a group of turbaned infidels

observed with less hesitancy the approach of a veiled lady on a camel.

But in Venice so many things were happening at once--more, Tony was

sure, than had ever happened in Boston in a twelve-month or in Salem in

a long lifetime. For here, by their garb, were people of every nation

on earth, Chinamen, Turks, Spaniards, and many more, mixed with a

parti-coloured throng of gentry, lacqueys, chapmen, hucksters, and tall

personages in parsons’ gowns who stalked through the crowd with an air

of mastery, a string of parasites at their heels. And all these people

seemed to be diverting themselves hugely, chaffering with the hucksters,

watching the antics of trained dogs and monkeys, distributing doles

to maimed beggars or having their pockets picked by slippery-looking

fellows in black--the whole with such an air of ease and good-humour

that one felt the cut-purses to be as much a part of the show as the

tumbling acrobats and animals.



As Tony advanced in years and experience this childish mumming lost

its magic; but not so the early imaginings it had excited. For the old

picture had been but the spring-board of fancy, the first step of a

cloud-ladder leading to a land of dreams. With these dreams the name

of Venice remained associated; and all that observation or report

subsequently brought him concerning the place seemed, on a sober

warranty of fact, to confirm its claim to stand midway between

reality and illusion. There was, for instance, a slender Venice glass,

gold-powdered as with lily-pollen or the dust of sunbeams, that,

standing in the corner cabinet betwixt two Lowestoft caddies, seemed,

among its lifeless neighbours, to palpitate like an impaled butterfly.

There was, farther, a gold chain of his mother’s, spun of that same

sun-pollen, so thread-like, impalpable, that it slipped through the

fingers like light, yet so strong that it carried a heavy pendant which

seemed held in air as if by magic. MAGIC! That was the word which the

thought of Venice evoked. It was the kind of place, Tony felt, in which

things elsewhere impossible might naturally happen, in which two and two

might make five, a paradox elope with a syllogism, and a conclusion give

the lie to its own premiss. Was there ever a young heart that did not,

once and again, long to get away into such a world as that? Tony, at

least, had felt the longing from the first hour when the axioms in

his horn-book had brought home to him his heavy responsibilities as a

Christian and a sinner. And now here was his wish taking shape before

him, as the distant haze of gold shaped itself into towers and domes

across the morning sea!



The Reverend Ozias Mounce, Tony’s governor and bear-leader, was just

putting a hand to the third clause of the fourth part of a sermon

on Free-Will and Predestination as the Hepzibah B.’s anchor rattled

overboard. Tony, in his haste to be ashore, would have made one plunge

with the anchor; but the Reverend Ozias, on being roused from his

lucubrations, earnestly protested against leaving his argument in

suspense. What was the trifle of an arrival at some Papistical

foreign city, where the very churches wore turbans like so many

Moslem idolators, to the important fact of Mr. Mounce’s summing up his

conclusions before the Muse of Theology took flight? He should be happy,

he said, if the tide served, to visit Venice with Mr. Bracknell the next

morning.



The next morning, ha!--Tony murmured a submissive “Yes, sir,” winked at

the subjugated captain, buckled on his sword, pressed his hat down

with a flourish, and before the Reverend Ozias had arrived at his next

deduction, was skimming merrily shoreward in the Hepzibah’s gig.



A moment more and he was in the thick of it! Here was the very world of

the old print, only suffused with sunlight and colour, and bubbling

with merry noises. What a scene it was! A square enclosed in fantastic

painted buildings, and peopled with a throng as fantastic: a bawling,

laughing, jostling, sweating mob, parti-coloured, parti-speeched,

crackling and sputtering under the hot sun like a dish of fritters over

a kitchen fire. Tony, agape, shouldered his way through the press, aware

at once that, spite of the tumult, the shrillness, the gesticulation,

there was no undercurrent of clownishness, no tendency to horse-play,

as in such crowds on market-day at home, but a kind of facetious suavity

which seemed to include everybody in the circumference of one huge joke.

In such an air the sense of strangeness soon wore off, and Tony was

beginning to feel himself vastly at home, when a lift of the tide bore

him against a droll-looking bell-ringing fellow who carried above his

head a tall metal tree hung with sherbet-glasses.



The encounter set the glasses spinning and three or four spun off and

clattered to the stones. The sherbet-seller called on all the saints,

and Tony, clapping a lordly hand to his pocket, tossed him a ducat by

mistake for a sequin. The fellow’s eyes shot out of their orbits,

and just then a personable-looking young man who had observed the

transaction stepped up to Tony and said pleasantly, in English:



“I perceive, sir, that you are not familiar with our currency.”



“Does he want more?” says Tony, very lordly; whereat the other laughed

and replied: “You have given him enough to retire from his business and

open a gaming-house over the arcade.”



Tony joined in the laugh, and this incident bridging the preliminaries,

the two young men were presently hobnobbing over a glass of Canary in

front of one of the coffee-houses about the square. Tony counted

himself lucky to have run across an English-speaking companion who was

good-natured enough to give him a clue to the labyrinth; and when he had

paid for the Canary (in the coin his friend selected) they set out

again to view the town. The Italian gentleman, who called himself Count

Rialto, appeared to have a very numerous acquaintance, and was able to

point out to Tony all the chief dignitaries of the state, the men of ton

and ladies of fashion, as well as a number of other characters of a kind

not openly mentioned in taking a census of Salem.



Tony, who was not averse from reading when nothing better offered,

had perused the “Merchant of Venice” and Mr. Otway’s fine tragedy; but

though these pieces had given him a notion that the social usages of

Venice differed from those at home, he was unprepared for the surprising

appearance and manners of the great people his friend named to him. The

gravest Senators of the Republic went in prodigious striped trousers,

short cloaks and feathered hats. One nobleman wore a ruff and doctor’s

gown, another a black velvet tunic slashed with rose-colour; while the

President of the dreaded Council of Ten was a terrible strutting fellow

with a rapier-like nose, a buff leather jerkin and a trailing scarlet

cloak that the crowd was careful not to step on.



It was all vastly diverting, and Tony would gladly have gone on forever;

but he had given his word to the captain to be at the landing-place at

sunset, and here was dusk already creeping over the skies! Tony was a

man of honour; and having pressed on the Count a handsome damascened

dagger selected from one of the goldsmiths’ shops in a narrow street

lined with such wares, he insisted on turning his face toward the

Hepzibah’s gig. The Count yielded reluctantly; but as they came out

again on the square they were caught in a great throng pouring toward

the doors of the cathedral.



“They go to Benediction,” said the Count. “A beautiful sight, with many

lights and flowers. It is a pity you cannot take a peep at it.”



Tony thought so too, and in another minute a legless beggar had pulled

back the leathern flap of the cathedral door, and they stood in a

haze of gold and perfume that seemed to rise and fall on the mighty

undulations of the organ. Here the press was as thick as without; and as

Tony flattened himself against a pillar, he heard a pretty voice at his

elbow:--“Oh, sir, oh, sir, your sword!”



He turned at sound of the broken English, and saw a girl who matched the

voice trying to disengage her dress from the tip of his scabbard.

She wore one of the voluminous black hoods which the Venetian ladies

affected, and under its projecting eaves her face spied out at him as

sweet as a nesting bird.



In the dusk their hands met over the scabbard, and as she freed herself

a shred of her lace flounce clung to Tony’s enchanted fingers. Looking

after her, he saw she was on the arm of a pompous-looking graybeard in

a long black gown and scarlet stockings, who, on perceiving the

exchange of glances between the young people, drew the lady away with a

threatening look.



The Count met Tony’s eye with a smile. “One of our Venetian beauties,”

 said he; “the lovely Polixena Cador. She is thought to have the finest

eyes in Venice.”



“She spoke English,” stammered Tony.



“Oh--ah--precisely: she learned the language at the Court of Saint

James’s, where her father, the Senator, was formerly accredited as

Ambassador. She played as an infant with the royal princes of England.”



“And that was her father?”



“Assuredly: young ladies of Donna Polixena’s rank do not go abroad save

with their parents or a duenna.”



Just then a soft hand slid into Tony’s. His heart gave a foolish bound,

and he turned about half-expecting to meet again the merry eyes under

the hood; but saw instead a slender brown boy, in some kind of fanciful

page’s dress, who thrust a folded paper between his fingers and vanished

in the throng. Tony, in a tingle, glanced surreptitiously at the Count,

who appeared absorbed in his prayers. The crowd, at the ringing of a

bell, had in fact been overswept by a sudden wave of devotion; and Tony

seized the moment to step beneath a lighted shrine with his letter.



“I am in dreadful trouble and implore your help. Polixena”--he read;

but hardly had he seized the sense of the words when a hand fell on his

shoulder, and a stern-looking man in a cocked hat, and bearing a kind of

rod or mace, pronounced a few words in Venetian.



Tony, with a start, thrust the letter in his breast, and tried to jerk

himself free; but the harder he jerked the tighter grew the other’s

grip, and the Count, presently perceiving what had happened, pushed

his way through the crowd, and whispered hastily to his companion: “For

God’s sake, make no struggle. This is serious. Keep quiet and do as I

tell you.”



Tony was no chicken-heart. He had something of a name for pugnacity

among the lads of his own age at home, and was not the man to stand in

Venice what he would have resented in Salem; but the devil of it was

that this black fellow seemed to be pointing to the letter in his

breast; and this suspicion was confirmed by the Count’s agitated

whisper.



“This is one of the agents of the Ten.--For God’s sake, no outcry.” He

exchanged a word or two with the mace-bearer and again turned to Tony.

“You have been seen concealing a letter about your person--”



“And what of that?” says Tony furiously.



“Gently, gently, my master. A letter handed to you by the page of Donna

Polixena Cador.--A black business! Oh, a very black business! This Cador

is one of the most powerful nobles in Venice--I beseech you, not a word,

sir! Let me think--deliberate--”



His hand on Tony’s shoulder, he carried on a rapid dialogue with the

potentate in the cocked hat.



“I am sorry, sir--but our young ladies of rank are as jealously guarded

as the Grand Turk’s wives, and you must be answerable for this scandal.

The best I can do is to have you taken privately to the Palazzo Cador,

instead of being brought before the Council. I have pleaded your youth

and inexperience”--Tony winced at this--“and I think the business may

still be arranged.”



Meanwhile the agent of the Ten had yielded his place to a sharp-featured

shabby-looking fellow in black, dressed somewhat like a lawyer’s clerk,

who laid a grimy hand on Tony’s arm, and with many apologetic gestures

steered him through the crowd to the doors of the church. The Count held

him by the other arm, and in this fashion they emerged on the square,

which now lay in darkness save for the many lights twinkling under the

arcade and in the windows of the gaming-rooms above it.



Tony by this time had regained voice enough to declare that he would go

where they pleased, but that he must first say a word to the mate of the

Hepzibah, who had now been awaiting him some two hours or more at the

landing-place.



The Count repeated this to Tony’s custodian, but the latter shook his

head and rattled off a sharp denial.



“Impossible, sir,” said the Count. “I entreat you not to insist. Any

resistance will tell against you in the end.”



Tony fell silent. With a rapid eye he was measuring his chances of

escape. In wind and limb he was more than a mate for his captors, and

boyhood’s ruses were not so far behind him but he felt himself equal to

outwitting a dozen grown men; but he had the sense to see that at a cry

the crowd would close in on him. Space was what he wanted: a clear ten

yards, and he would have laughed at Doge and Council. But the throng was

thick as glue, and he walked on submissively, keeping his eye alert for

an opening. Suddenly the mob swerved aside after some new show. Tony’s

fist shot out at the black fellow’s chest, and before the latter could

right himself the young New Englander was showing a clean pair of heels

to his escort. On he sped, cleaving the crowd like a flood-tide in

Gloucester bay, diving under the first arch that caught his eye,

dashing down a lane to an unlit water-way, and plunging across a narrow

hump-back bridge which landed him in a black pocket between walls. But

now his pursuers were at his back, reinforced by the yelping mob. The

walls were too high to scale, and for all his courage Tony’s breath came

short as he paced the masonry cage in which ill-luck had landed him.

Suddenly a gate opened in one of the walls, and a slip of a servant

wench looked out and beckoned him. There was no time to weigh chances.

Tony dashed through the gate, his rescuer slammed and bolted it, and the

two stood in a narrow paved well between high houses.









II





The servant picked up a lantern and signed to Tony to follow her. They

climbed a squalid stairway of stone, felt their way along a corridor,

and entered a tall vaulted room feebly lit by an oil-lamp hung from

the painted ceiling. Tony discerned traces of former splendour in his

surroundings, but he had no time to examine them, for a figure started

up at his approach and in the dim light he recognized the girl who was

the cause of all his troubles.



She sprang toward him with outstretched hands, but as he advanced her

face changed and she shrank back abashed.



“This is a misunderstanding--a dreadful misunderstanding,” she cried

out in her pretty broken English. “Oh, how does it happen that you are

here?”



“Through no choice of my own, madam, I assure you!” retorted Tony, not

over-pleased by his reception.



“But why--how--how did you make this unfortunate mistake?”



“Why, madam, if you’ll excuse my candour, I think the mistake was

yours--”



“Mine?”



--“in sending me a letter--”



“YOU--a letter?”



--“by a simpleton of a lad, who must needs hand it to me under your

father’s very nose--”



The girl broke in on him with a cry. “What! It was YOU who received my

letter?” She swept round on the little maid-servant and submerged her

under a flood of Venetian. The latter volleyed back in the same jargon,

and as she did so, Tony’s astonished eye detected in her the doubleted

page who had handed him the letter in Saint Mark’s.



“What!” he cried, “the lad was this girl in disguise?”



Polixena broke off with an irrepressible smile; but her face clouded

instantly and she returned to the charge.



“This wicked, careless girl--she has ruined me, she will be my undoing!

Oh, sir, how can I make you understand? The letter was not intended

for you--it was meant for the English Ambassador, an old friend of my

mother’s, from whom I hoped to obtain assistance--oh, how can I ever

excuse myself to you?”



“No excuses are needed, madam,” said Tony, bowing; “though I am

surprised, I own, that any one should mistake me for an ambassador.”



Here a wave of mirth again overran Polixena’s face. “Oh, sir, you

must pardon my poor girl’s mistake. She heard you speaking English,

and--and--I had told her to hand the letter to the handsomest foreigner

in the church.” Tony bowed again, more profoundly. “The English

Ambassador,” Polixena added simply, “is a very handsome man.”



“I wish, madam, I were a better proxy!”



She echoed his laugh, and then clapped her hands together with a look

of anguish. “Fool that I am! How can I jest at such a moment? I am in

dreadful trouble, and now perhaps I have brought trouble on you also--

Oh, my father! I hear my father coming!” She turned pale and leaned

tremblingly upon the little servant.



Footsteps and loud voices were in fact heard outside, and a moment

later the red-stockinged Senator stalked into the room attended by

half-a-dozen of the magnificoes whom Tony had seen abroad in the square.

At sight of him, all clapped hands to their swords and burst into

furious outcries; and though their jargon was unintelligible to the

young man, their tones and gestures made their meaning unpleasantly

plain. The Senator, with a start of anger, first flung himself on the

intruder; then, snatched back by his companions, turned wrathfully on

his daughter, who, at his feet, with outstretched arms and streaming

face, pleaded her cause with all the eloquence of young distress.

Meanwhile the other nobles gesticulated vehemently among themselves,

and one, a truculent-looking personage in ruff and Spanish cape, stalked

apart, keeping a jealous eye on Tony. The latter was at his wit’s

end how to comport himself, for the lovely Polixena’s tears had

quite drowned her few words of English, and beyond guessing that the

magnificoes meant him a mischief he had no notion what they would be at.



At this point, luckily, his friend Count Rialto suddenly broke in on

the scene, and was at once assailed by all the tongues in the room. He

pulled a long face at sight of Tony, but signed to the young man to be

silent, and addressed himself earnestly to the Senator. The latter, at

first, would not draw breath to hear him; but presently, sobering,

he walked apart with the Count, and the two conversed together out of

earshot.



“My dear sir,” said the Count, at length turning to Tony with a

perturbed countenance, “it is as I feared, and you are fallen into a

great misfortune.”



“A great misfortune! A great trap, I call it!” shouted Tony, whose

blood, by this time, was boiling; but as he uttered the word the

beautiful Polixena cast such a stricken look on him that he blushed up

to the forehead.



“Be careful,” said the Count, in a low tone. “Though his Illustriousness

does not speak your language, he understands a few words of it, and--”



“So much the better!” broke in Tony; “I hope he will understand me if I

ask him in plain English what is his grievance against me.”



The Senator, at this, would have burst forth again; but the Count,

stepping between, answered quickly: “His grievance against you is that

you have been detected in secret correspondence with his daughter, the

most noble Polixena Cador, the betrothed bride of this gentleman, the

most illustrious Marquess Zanipolo--” and he waved a deferential hand at

the frowning hidalgo of the cape and ruff.



“Sir,” said Tony, “if that is the extent of my offence, it lies with

the young lady to set me free, since by her own avowal--” but here he

stopped short, for, to his surprise, Polixena shot a terrified glance at

him.



“Sir,” interposed the Count, “we are not accustomed in Venice to take

shelter behind a lady’s reputation.”



“No more are we in Salem,” retorted Tony in a white heat. “I was merely

about to remark that, by the young lady’s avowal, she has never seen me

before.”



Polixena’s eyes signalled her gratitude, and he felt he would have died

to defend her.



The Count translated his statement, and presently pursued: “His

Illustriousness observes that, in that case, his daughter’s misconduct

has been all the more reprehensible.”



“Her misconduct? Of what does he accuse her?”



“Of sending you, just now, in the church of Saint Mark’s, a letter which

you were seen to read openly and thrust in your bosom. The incident

was witnessed by his Illustriousness the Marquess Zanipolo, who, in

consequence, has already repudiated his unhappy bride.”



Tony stared contemptuously at the black Marquess. “If his

Illustriousness is so lacking in gallantry as to repudiate a lady on so

trivial a pretext, it is he and not I who should be the object of her

father’s resentment.”



“That, my dear young gentleman, is hardly for you to decide. Your only

excuse being your ignorance of our customs, it is scarcely for you to

advise us how to behave in matters of punctilio.”



It seemed to Tony as though the Count were going over to his enemies,

and the thought sharpened his retort.



“I had supposed,” said he, “that men of sense had much the same

behaviour in all countries, and that, here as elsewhere, a gentleman

would be taken at his word. I solemnly affirm that the letter I was seen

to read reflects in no way on the honour of this young lady, and has in

fact nothing to do with what you suppose.”



As he had himself no notion what the letter was about, this was as far

as he dared commit himself.



There was another brief consultation in the opposing camp, and the

Count then said:--“We all know, sir, that a gentleman is obliged to meet

certain enquiries by a denial; but you have at your command the means of

immediately clearing the lady. Will you show the letter to her father?”



There was a perceptible pause, during which Tony, while appearing to

look straight before him, managed to deflect an interrogatory glance

toward Polixena. Her reply was a faint negative motion, accompanied by

unmistakable signs of apprehension.



“Poor girl!” he thought, “she is in a worse case than I imagined, and

whatever happens I must keep her secret.”



He turned to the Senator with a deep bow. “I am not,” said he, “in the

habit of showing my private correspondence to strangers.”



The Count interpreted these words, and Donna Polixena’s father, dashing

his hand on his hilt, broke into furious invective, while the Marquess

continued to nurse his outraged feelings aloof.



The Count shook his head funereally. “Alas, sir, it is as I feared.

This is not the first time that youth and propinquity have led to fatal

imprudence. But I need hardly, I suppose, point out the obligation

incumbent upon you as a man of honour.”



Tony stared at him haughtily, with a look which was meant for the

Marquess. “And what obligation is that?”



“To repair the wrong you have done--in other words, to marry the lady.”



Polixena at this burst into tears, and Tony said to himself: “Why in

heaven does she not bid me show the letter?” Then he remembered that it

had no superscription, and that the words it contained, supposing them

to have been addressed to himself, were hardly of a nature to disarm

suspicion. The sense of the girl’s grave plight effaced all thought of

his own risk, but the Count’s last words struck him as so preposterous

that he could not repress a smile.



“I cannot flatter myself,” said he, “that the lady would welcome this

solution.”



The Count’s manner became increasingly ceremonious. “Such modesty,”

 he said, “becomes your youth and inexperience; but even if it were

justified it would scarcely alter the case, as it is always assumed in

this country that a young lady wishes to marry the man whom her father

has selected.”



“But I understood just now,” Tony interposed, “that the gentleman yonder

was in that enviable position.”



“So he was, till circumstances obliged him to waive the privilege in

your favour.”



“He does me too much honour; but if a deep sense of my unworthiness

obliges me to decline--”



“You are still,” interrupted the Count, “labouring under a

misapprehension. Your choice in the matter is no more to be consulted

than the lady’s. Not to put too fine a point on it, it is necessary that

you should marry her within the hour.”



Tony, at this, for all his spirit, felt the blood run thin in his veins.

He looked in silence at the threatening visages between himself and the

door, stole a side-glance at the high barred windows of the apartment,

and then turned to Polixena, who had fallen sobbing at her father’s

feet.



“And if I refuse?” said he.



The Count made a significant gesture. “I am not so foolish as to

threaten a man of your mettle. But perhaps you are unaware what the

consequences would be to the lady.”



Polixena, at this, struggling to her feet, addressed a few impassioned

words to the Count and her father; but the latter put her aside with an

obdurate gesture.



The Count turned to Tony. “The lady herself pleads for you--at what

cost you do not guess--but as you see it is vain. In an hour his

Illustriousness’s chaplain will be here. Meanwhile his Illustriousness

consents to leave you in the custody of your betrothed.”



He stepped back, and the other gentlemen, bowing with deep ceremony to

Tony, stalked out one by one from the room. Tony heard the key turn in

the lock, and found himself alone with Polixena.









III





The girl had sunk into a chair, her face hidden, a picture of shame

and agony. So moving was the sight that Tony once again forgot his own

extremity in the view of her distress. He went and kneeled beside her,

drawing her hands from her face.



“Oh, don’t make me look at you!” she sobbed; but it was on his bosom

that she hid from his gaze. He held her there a breathing-space, as

he might have clasped a weeping child; then she drew back and put him

gently from her.



“What humiliation!” she lamented.



“Do you think I blame you for what has happened?”



“Alas, was it not my foolish letter that brought you to this plight? And

how nobly you defended me! How generous it was of you not to show the

letter! If my father knew I had written to the Ambassador to save me

from this dreadful marriage his anger against me would be even greater.”



“Ah--it was that you wrote for?” cried Tony with unaccountable relief.



“Of course--what else did you think?”



“But is it too late for the Ambassador to save you?”



“From YOU?” A smile flashed through her tears. “Alas, yes.” She drew

back and hid her face again, as though overcome by a fresh wave of

shame.



Tony glanced about him. “If I could wrench a bar out of that window--”

 he muttered.



“Impossible! The court is guarded. You are a prisoner, alas.--Oh, I must

speak!” She sprang up and paced the room. “But indeed you can scarce

think worse of me than you do already--”



“I think ill of you?”



“Alas, you must! To be unwilling to marry the man my father has chosen

for me--”



“Such a beetle-browed lout! It would be a burning shame if you married

him.”



“Ah, you come from a free country. Here a girl is allowed no choice.”



“It is infamous, I say--infamous!”



“No, no--I ought to have resigned myself, like so many others.”



“Resigned yourself to that brute! Impossible!”



“He has a dreadful name for violence--his gondolier has told my little

maid such tales of him! But why do I talk of myself, when it is of you I

should be thinking?”



“Of me, poor child?” cried Tony, losing his head.



“Yes, and how to save you--for I CAN save you! But every moment

counts--and yet what I have to say is so dreadful.”



“Nothing from your lips could seem dreadful.”



“Ah, if he had had your way of speaking!”



“Well, now at least you are free of him,” said Tony, a little wildly;

but at this she stood up and bent a grave look on him.



“No, I am not free,” she said; “but you are, if you will do as I tell

you.”



Tony, at this, felt a sudden dizziness; as though, from a mad flight

through clouds and darkness, he had dropped to safety again, and the

fall had stunned him.



“What am I to do?” he said.



“Look away from me, or I can never tell you.”



He thought at first that this was a jest, but her eyes commanded him,

and reluctantly he walked away and leaned in the embrasure of the

window. She stood in the middle of the room, and as soon as his back

was turned she began to speak in a quick monotonous voice, as though she

were reciting a lesson.



“You must know that the Marquess Zanipolo, though a great noble, is

not a rich man. True, he has large estates, but he is a desperate

spendthrift and gambler, and would sell his soul for a round sum of

ready money.--If you turn round I shall not go on!--He wrangled horribly

with my father over my dowry--he wanted me to have more than either of

my sisters, though one married a Procurator and the other a grandee

of Spain. But my father is a gambler too--oh, such fortunes as are

squandered over the arcade yonder! And so--and so--don’t turn, I implore

you--oh, do you begin to see my meaning?”



She broke off sobbing, and it took all his strength to keep his eyes

from her.



“Go on,” he said.



“Will you not understand? Oh, I would say anything to save you! You

don’t know us Venetians--we’re all to be bought for a price. It is

not only the brides who are marketable--sometimes the husbands sell

themselves too. And they think you rich--my father does, and the

others--I don’t know why, unless you have shown your money too

freely--and the English are all rich, are they not? And--oh, oh--do you

understand? Oh, I can’t bear your eyes!”



She dropped into a chair, her head on her arms, and Tony in a flash was

at her side.



“My poor child, my poor Polixena!” he cried, and wept and clasped her.



“You ARE rich, are you not? You would promise them a ransom?” she

persisted.



“To enable you to marry the Marquess?”



“To enable you to escape from this place. Oh, I hope I may never see

your face again.” She fell to weeping once more, and he drew away and

paced the floor in a fever.



Presently she sprang up with a fresh air of resolution, and pointed to a

clock against the wall. “The hour is nearly over. It is quite true that

my father is gone to fetch his chaplain. Oh, I implore you, be warned by

me! There is no other way of escape.”



“And if I do as you say--?”



“You are safe! You are free! I stake my life on it.”



“And you--you are married to that villain?”



“But I shall have saved you. Tell me your name, that I may say it to

myself when I am alone.”



“My name is Anthony. But you must not marry that fellow.”



“You forgive me, Anthony? You don’t think too badly of me?”



“I say you must not marry that fellow.”



She laid a trembling hand on his arm. “Time presses,” she adjured him,

“and I warn you there is no other way.”



For a moment he had a vision of his mother, sitting very upright, on a

Sunday evening, reading Dr. Tillotson’s sermons in the best parlour at

Salem; then he swung round on the girl and caught both her hands in his.

“Yes, there is,” he cried, “if you are willing. Polixena, let the priest

come!”



She shrank back from him, white and radiant. “Oh, hush, be silent!” she

said.



“I am no noble Marquess, and have no great estates,” he cried. “My

father is a plain India merchant in the colony of Massachusetts--but if

you--”



“Oh, hush, I say! I don’t know what your long words mean. But I bless

you, bless you, bless you on my knees!” And she knelt before him, and

fell to kissing his hands.



He drew her up to his breast and held her there.



“You are willing, Polixena?” he said.



“No, no!” She broke from him with outstretched hands. “I am not willing.

You mistake me. I must marry the Marquess, I tell you!”



“On my money?” he taunted her; and her burning blush rebuked him.



“Yes, on your money,” she said sadly.



“Why? Because, much as you hate him, you hate me still more?”



She was silent.



“If you hate me, why do you sacrifice yourself for me?” he persisted.



“You torture me! And I tell you the hour is past.”



“Let it pass. I’ll not accept your sacrifice. I will not lift a finger

to help another man to marry you.”



“Oh, madman, madman!” she murmured.



Tony, with crossed arms, faced her squarely, and she leaned against the

wall a few feet off from him. Her breast throbbed under its lace and

falbalas, and her eyes swam with terror and entreaty.



“Polixena, I love you!” he cried.



A blush swept over her throat and bosom, bathing her in light to the

verge of her troubled brows.



“I love you! I love you!” he repeated.



And now she was on his breast again, and all their youth was in their

lips. But her embrace was as fleeting as a bird’s poise and before he

knew it he clasped empty air, and half the room was between them.



She was holding up a little coral charm and laughing. “I took it from

your fob,” she said. “It is of no value, is it? And I shall not get any

of the money, you know.”



She continued to laugh strangely, and the rouge burned like fire in her

ashen face.



“What are you talking of?” he said.



“They never give me anything but the clothes I wear. And I shall never

see you again, Anthony!” She gave him a dreadful look. “Oh, my poor boy,

my poor love--‘I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU, POLIXENA!’”



He thought she had turned light-headed, and advanced to her with

soothing words; but she held him quietly at arm’s length, and as he

gazed he read the truth in her face.



He fell back from her, and a sob broke from him as he bowed his head on

his hands.



“Only, for God’s sake, have the money ready, or there may be foul play

here,” she said.



As she spoke there was a great tramping of steps outside and a burst of

voices on the threshold.



“It is all a lie,” she gasped out, “about my marriage, and the Marquess,

and the Ambassador, and the Senator--but not, oh, not about your danger

in this place--or about my love,” she breathed to him. And as the key

rattled in the door she laid her lips on his brow.



The key rattled, and the door swung open--but the black-cassocked

gentleman who stepped in, though a priest indeed, was no votary of

idolatrous rites, but that sound orthodox divine, the Reverend Ozias

Mounce, looking very much perturbed at his surroundings, and very much

on the alert for the Scarlet Woman. He was supported, to his evident

relief, by the captain of the Hepzibah B., and the procession was closed

by an escort of stern-looking fellows in cocked hats and small-swords,

who led between them Tony’s late friends the magnificoes, now as sorry a

looking company as the law ever landed in her net.



The captain strode briskly into the room, uttering a grunt of

satisfaction as he clapped eyes on Tony.



“So, Mr. Bracknell,” said he, “you have been seeing the Carnival with

this pack of mummers, have you? And this is where your pleasuring has

landed you? H’m--a pretty establishment, and a pretty lady at the head

of it.” He glanced about the apartment and doffed his hat with mock

ceremony to Polixena, who faced him like a princess.



“Why, my girl,” said he, amicably, “I think I saw you this morning in

the square, on the arm of the Pantaloon yonder; and as for that Captain

Spavent--” and he pointed a derisive finger at the Marquess--“I’ve

watched him drive his bully’s trade under the arcade ever since I

first dropped anchor in these waters. Well, well,” he continued, his

indignation subsiding, “all’s fair in Carnival, I suppose, but this

gentleman here is under sailing orders, and I fear we must break up your

little party.”



At this Tony saw Count Rialto step forward, looking very small and

explanatory, and uncovering obsequiously to the captain.



“I can assure you, sir,” said the Count in his best English, “that this

incident is the result of an unfortunate misunderstanding, and if you

will oblige us by dismissing these myrmidons, any of my friends

here will be happy to offer satisfaction to Mr. Bracknell and his

companions.”



Mr. Mounce shrank visibly at this, and the captain burst into a loud

guffaw.



“Satisfaction?” says he. “Why, my cock, that’s very handsome of you,

considering the rope’s at your throats. But we’ll not take advantage of

your generosity, for I fear Mr. Bracknell has already trespassed on

it too long. You pack of galley-slaves, you!” he spluttered suddenly,

“decoying young innocents with that devil’s bait of yours--” His eye

fell on Polixena, and his voice softened unaccountably. “Ah, well, we

must all see the Carnival once, I suppose,” he said. “All’s well that

ends well, as the fellow says in the play; and now, if you please, Mr.

Bracknell, if you’ll take the reverend gentleman’s arm there, we’ll

bid adieu to our hospitable entertainers, and right about face for the

Hepzibah.”





The End of A Venetian Night’s Entertainment











XINGU



December, 1911





Mrs. Ballinger is one of the ladies who pursue Culture in bands, as

though it were dangerous to meet alone. To this end she had founded

the Lunch Club, an association composed of herself and several other

indomitable huntresses of erudition. The Lunch Club, after three or four

winters of lunching and debate, had acquired such local distinction that

the entertainment of distinguished strangers became one of its accepted

functions; in recognition of which it duly extended to the celebrated

“Osric Dane,” on the day of her arrival in Hillbridge, an invitation to

be present at the next meeting.



The Club was to meet at Mrs. Ballinger’s. The other members, behind

her back, were of one voice in deploring her unwillingness to cede

her rights in favor of Mrs. Plinth, whose house made a more impressive

setting for the entertainment of celebrities; while, as Mrs. Leveret

observed, there was always the picture-gallery to fall back on.



Mrs. Plinth made no secret of sharing this view. She had always regarded

it as one of her obligations to entertain the Lunch Club’s distinguished

guests. Mrs. Plinth was almost as proud of her obligations as she was

of her picture-gallery; she was in fact fond of implying that the one

possession implied the other, and that only a woman of her wealth

could afford to live up to a standard as high as that which she had set

herself. An all-round sense of duty, roughly adaptable to various ends,

was, in her opinion, all that Providence exacted of the more humbly

stationed; but the power which had predestined Mrs. Plinth to keep

footmen clearly intended her to maintain an equally specialized staff of

responsibilities. It was the more to be regretted that Mrs. Ballinger,

whose obligations to society were bounded by the narrow scope of two

parlour-maids, should have been so tenacious of the right to entertain

Osric Dane.



The question of that lady’s reception had for a month past profoundly

moved the members of the Lunch Club. It was not that they felt

themselves unequal to the task, but that their sense of the opportunity

plunged them into the agreeable uncertainty of the lady who weighs the

alternatives of a well-stocked wardrobe. If such subsidiary members as

Mrs. Leveret were fluttered by the thought of exchanging ideas with the

author of “The Wings of Death,” no forebodings of the kind disturbed the

conscious adequacy of Mrs. Plinth, Mrs. Ballinger and Miss Van Vluyck.

“The Wings of Death” had, in fact, at Miss Van Vluyck’s suggestion, been

chosen as the subject of discussion at the last club meeting, and

each member had thus been enabled to express her own opinion or to

appropriate whatever seemed most likely to be of use in the comments

of the others. Mrs. Roby alone had abstained from profiting by the

opportunity thus offered; but it was now openly recognised that, as a

member of the Lunch Club, Mrs. Roby was a failure. “It all comes,” as

Miss Van Vluyck put it, “of accepting a woman on a man’s estimation.”

 Mrs. Roby, returning to Hillbridge from a prolonged sojourn in exotic

regions--the other ladies no longer took the trouble to remember

where--had been emphatically commended by the distinguished biologist,

Professor Foreland, as the most agreeable woman he had ever met; and the

members of the Lunch Club, awed by an encomium that carried the weight

of a diploma, and rashly assuming that the Professor’s social sympathies

would follow the line of his scientific bent, had seized the chance of

annexing a biological member. Their disillusionment was complete. At

Miss Van Vluyck’s first off-hand mention of the pterodactyl Mrs. Roby

had confusedly murmured: “I know so little about metres--” and after

that painful betrayal of incompetence she had prudently withdrawn from

farther participation in the mental gymnastics of the club.



“I suppose she flattered him,” Miss Van Vluyck summed up--“or else it’s

the way she does her hair.”



The dimensions of Miss Van Vluyck’s dining-room having restricted the

membership of the club to six, the non-conductiveness of one member was

a serious obstacle to the exchange of ideas, and some wonder had already

been expressed that Mrs. Roby should care to live, as it were, on the

intellectual bounty of the others. This feeling was augmented by the

discovery that she had not yet read “The Wings of Death.” She owned

to having heard the name of Osric Dane; but that--incredible as it

appeared--was the extent of her acquaintance with the celebrated

novelist. The ladies could not conceal their surprise, but Mrs.

Ballinger, whose pride in the club made her wish to put even Mrs. Roby

in the best possible light, gently insinuated that, though she had not

had time to acquaint herself with “The Wings of Death,” she must at

least be familiar with its equally remarkable predecessor, “The Supreme

Instant.”



Mrs. Roby wrinkled her sunny brows in a conscientious effort of memory,

as a result of which she recalled that, oh, yes, she HAD seen the book

at her brother’s, when she was staying with him in Brazil, and had even

carried it off to read one day on a boating party; but they had all

got to shying things at each other in the boat, and the book had gone

overboard, so she had never had the chance--



The picture evoked by this anecdote did not advance Mrs. Roby’s credit

with the club, and there was a painful pause, which was broken by

Mrs. Plinth’s remarking: “I can understand that, with all your other

pursuits, you should not find much time for reading; but I should have

thought you might at least have GOT UP ‘The Wings of Death’ before Osric

Dane’s arrival.”



Mrs. Roby took this rebuke good-humouredly. She had meant, she owned

to glance through the book; but she had been so absorbed in a novel of

Trollope’s that--



“No one reads Trollope now,” Mrs. Ballinger interrupted impatiently.



Mrs. Roby looked pained. “I’m only just beginning,” she confessed.



“And does he interest you?” Mrs. Plinth inquired.



“He amuses me.”



“Amusement,” said Mrs. Plinth sententiously, “is hardly what I look for

in my choice of books.”



“Oh, certainly, ‘The Wings of Death’ is not amusing,” ventured Mrs.

Leveret, whose manner of putting forth an opinion was like that of an

obliging salesman with a variety of other styles to submit if his first

selection does not suit.



“Was it MEANT to be?” enquired Mrs. Plinth, who was fond of asking

questions that she permitted no one but herself to answer. “Assuredly

not.”



“Assuredly not--that is what I was going to say,” assented Mrs. Leveret,

hastily rolling up her opinion and reaching for another. “It was meant

to--to elevate.”



Miss Van Vluyck adjusted her spectacles as though they were the black

cap of condemnation. “I hardly see,” she interposed, “how a book steeped

in the bitterest pessimism can be said to elevate, however much it may

instruct.”



“I meant, of course, to instruct,” said Mrs. Leveret, flurried by the

unexpected distinction between two terms which she had supposed to be

synonymous. Mrs. Leveret’s enjoyment of the Lunch Club was frequently

marred by such surprises; and not knowing her own value to the other

ladies as a mirror for their mental complacency she was sometimes

troubled by a doubt of her worthiness to join in their debates. It was

only the fact of having a dull sister who thought her clever that saved

her from a sense of hopeless inferiority.



“Do they get married in the end?” Mrs. Roby interposed.



“They--who?” the Lunch Club collectively exclaimed.



“Why, the girl and man. It’s a novel, isn’t it? I always think that’s

the one thing that matters. If they’re parted it spoils my dinner.”



Mrs. Plinth and Mrs. Ballinger exchanged scandalised glances, and the

latter said: “I should hardly advise you to read ‘The Wings of Death,’

in that spirit. For my part, when there are so many books that one HAS

to read, I wonder how any one can find time for those that are merely

amusing.”



“The beautiful part of it,” Laura Glyde murmured, “is surely just

this--that no one can tell HOW ‘The Wings of Death’ ends. Osric Dane,

overcome by the dread significance of her own meaning, has mercifully

veiled it--perhaps even from herself--as Apelles, in representing the

sacrifice of Iphigenia, veiled the face of Agamemnon.”



“What’s that? Is it poetry?” whispered Mrs. Leveret nervously to Mrs.

Plinth, who, disdaining a definite reply, said coldly: “You should

look it up. I always make it a point to look things up.” Her tone

added--“though I might easily have it done for me by the footman.”



“I was about to say,” Miss Van Vluyck resumed, “that it must always be a

question whether a book CAN instruct unless it elevates.”



“Oh--” murmured Mrs. Leveret, now feeling herself hopelessly astray.



“I don’t know,” said Mrs. Ballinger, scenting in Miss Van Vluyck’s tone

a tendency to depreciate the coveted distinction of entertaining Osric

Dane; “I don’t know that such a question can seriously be raised as to a

book which has attracted more attention among thoughtful people than any

novel since ‘Robert Elsmere.’”



“Oh, but don’t you see,” exclaimed Laura Glyde, “that it’s just the

dark hopelessness of it all--the wonderful tone-scheme of black on

black--that makes it such an artistic achievement? It reminded me so

when I read it of Prince Rupert’s MANIÈRE NOIRE... the book is etched,

not painted, yet one feels the colour values so intensely...”



“Who is HE?” Mrs. Leveret whispered to her neighbour. “Some one she’s

met abroad?”



“The wonderful part of the book,” Mrs. Ballinger conceded, “is that it

may be looked at from so many points of view. I hear that as a study of

determinism Professor Lupton ranks it with ‘The Data of Ethics.’”



“I’m told that Osric Dane spent ten years in preparatory studies

before beginning to write it,” said Mrs. Plinth. “She looks up

everything--verifies everything. It has always been my principle, as

you know. Nothing would induce me, now, to put aside a book before I’d

finished it, just because I can buy as many more as I want.”



“And what do YOU think of ‘The Wings of Death’?” Mrs. Roby abruptly

asked her.



It was the kind of question that might be termed out of order, and the

ladies glanced at each other as though disclaiming any share in such a

breach of discipline. They all knew that there was nothing Mrs. Plinth

so much disliked as being asked her opinion of a book. Books were

written to read; if one read them what more could be expected? To be

questioned in detail regarding the contents of a volume seemed to her

as great an outrage as being searched for smuggled laces at the Custom

House. The club had always respected this idiosyncrasy of Mrs. Plinth’s.

Such opinions as she had were imposing and substantial: her mind, like

her house, was furnished with monumental “pieces” that were not meant

to be suddenly disarranged; and it was one of the unwritten rules of

the Lunch Club that, within her own province, each member’s habits

of thought should be respected. The meeting therefore closed with

an increased sense, on the part of the other ladies, of Mrs. Roby’s

hopeless unfitness to be one of them.









II





Mrs. Leveret, on the eventful day, had arrived early at Mrs.

Ballinger’s, her volume of Appropriate Allusions in her pocket.



It always flustered Mrs. Leveret to be late at the Lunch Club: she liked

to collect her thoughts and gather a hint, as the others assembled, of

the turn the conversation was likely to take. To-day, however, she

felt herself completely at a loss; and even the familiar contact of

Appropriate Allusions, which stuck into her as she sat down, failed to

give her any reassurance. It was an admirable little volume, compiled

to meet all the social emergencies; so that, whether on the occasion

of Anniversaries, joyful or melancholy (as the classification ran),

of Banquets, social or municipal, or of Baptisms, Church of England

or sectarian, its student need never be at a loss for a pertinent

reference. Mrs. Leveret, though she had for years devoutly conned its

pages, valued it, however, rather for its moral support than for its

practical services; for though in the privacy of her own room she

commanded an army of quotations, these invariably deserted her at the

critical moment, and the only line she retained--CANST THOU DRAW OUT

LEVIATHAN WITH A HOOK?--was one she had never yet found the occasion to

apply.



To-day she felt that even the complete mastery of the volume would

hardly have insured her self-possession; for she thought it probable,

even if she DID, in some miraculous way, remember an Allusion, it would

be only to find that Osric Dane used a different volume (Mrs. Leveret

was convinced that literary people always carried them), and would

consequently not recognise her quotations.



Mrs. Leveret’s sense of being adrift was intensified by the appearance

of Mrs. Ballinger’s drawing-room. To a careless eye its aspect was

unchanged; but those acquainted with Mrs. Ballinger’s way of

arranging her books would instantly have detected the marks of recent

perturbation. Mrs. Ballinger’s province, as a member of the Lunch Club,

was the Book of the Day. On that, whatever it was, from a novel to

a treatise on experimental psychology, she was confidently,

authoritatively “up.” What became of last year’s books, or last week’s

even; what she did with the “subjects” she had previously professed with

equal authority; no one had ever yet discovered. Her mind was an hotel

where facts came and went like transient lodgers, without leaving their

address behind, and frequently without paying for their board. It was

Mrs. Ballinger’s boast that she was “abreast with the Thought of the

Day,” and her pride that this advanced position should be expressed by

the books on her drawing-room table. These volumes, frequently renewed,

and almost always damp from the press, bore names generally unfamiliar

to Mrs. Leveret, and giving her, as she furtively scanned them, a

disheartening glimpse of new fields of knowledge to be breathlessly

traversed in Mrs. Ballinger’s wake. But to-day a number of

maturer-looking volumes were adroitly mingled with the primeurs of the

press--Karl Marx jostled Professor Bergson, and the “Confessions of St.

Augustine” lay beside the last work on “Mendelism”; so that even to Mrs.

Leveret’s fluttered perceptions it was clear that Mrs. Ballinger didn’t

in the least know what Osric Dane was likely to talk about, and had

taken measures to be prepared for anything. Mrs. Leveret felt like a

passenger on an ocean steamer who is told that there is no immediate

danger, but that she had better put on her life-belt.



It was a relief to be roused from these forebodings by Miss Van Vluyck’s

arrival.



“Well, my dear,” the new-comer briskly asked her hostess, “what subjects

are we to discuss to-day?”



Mrs. Ballinger was furtively replacing a volume of Wordsworth by a copy

of Verlaine. “I hardly know,” she said somewhat nervously. “Perhaps we

had better leave that to circumstances.”



“Circumstances?” said Miss Van Vluyck drily. “That means, I suppose,

that Laura Glyde will take the floor as usual, and we shall be deluged

with literature.”



Philanthropy and statistics were Miss Van Vluyck’s province, and she

naturally resented any tendency to divert their guest’s attention from

these topics.



Mrs. Plinth at this moment appeared.



“Literature?” she protested in a tone of remonstrance. “But this is

perfectly unexpected. I understood we were to talk of Osric Dane’s

novel.”



Mrs. Ballinger winced at the discrimination, but let it pass. “We can

hardly make that our chief subject--at least not TOO intentionally,” she

suggested. “Of course we can let our talk DRIFT in that direction; but

we ought to have some other topic as an introduction, and that is what

I wanted to consult you about. The fact is, we know so little of Osric

Dane’s tastes and interests that it is difficult to make any special

preparation.”



“It may be difficult,” said Mrs. Plinth with decision, “but it is

absolutely necessary. I know what that happy-go-lucky principle

leads to. As I told one of my nieces the other day, there are certain

emergencies for which a lady should always be prepared. It’s in shocking

taste to wear colours when one pays a visit of condolence, or a last

year’s dress when there are reports that one’s husband is on the wrong

side of the market; and so it is with conversation. All I ask is that I

should know beforehand what is to be talked about; then I feel sure of

being able to say the proper thing.”



“I quite agree with you,” Mrs. Ballinger anxiously assented; “but--”



And at that instant, heralded by the fluttered parlour-maid, Osric Dane

appeared upon the threshold.



Mrs. Leveret told her sister afterward that she had known at a glance

what was coming. She saw that Osric Dane was not going to meet them

half way. That distinguished personage had indeed entered with an air of

compulsion not calculated to promote the easy exercise of hospitality.

She looked as though she were about to be photographed for a new edition

of her books.



The desire to propitiate a divinity is generally in inverse ratio to its

responsiveness, and the sense of discouragement produced by Osric Dane’s

entrance visibly increased the Lunch Club’s eagerness to please her. Any

lingering idea that she might consider herself under an obligation to

her entertainers was at once dispelled by her manner: as Mrs. Leveret

said afterward to her sister, she had a way of looking at you that made

you feel as if there was something wrong with your hat. This evidence

of greatness produced such an immediate impression on the ladies that a

shudder of awe ran through them when Mrs. Roby, as their hostess led

the great personage into the dining-room, turned back to whisper to the

others: “What a brute she is!”



The hour about the table did not tend to correct this verdict. It was

passed by Osric Dane in the silent deglutition of Mrs. Ballinger’s menu,

and by the members of the Club in the emission of tentative platitudes

which their guest seemed to swallow as perfunctorily as the successive

courses of the luncheon.



Mrs. Ballinger’s deplorable delay in fixing a topic had thrown the

Club into a mental disarray which increased with the return to the

drawing-room, where the actual business of discussion was to open. Each

lady waited for the other to speak; and there was a general shock

of disappointment when their hostess opened the conversation by the

painfully commonplace inquiry: “Is this your first visit to Hillbridge?”



Even Mrs. Leveret was conscious that this was a bad beginning; and a

vague impulse of deprecation made Miss Glyde interject: “It is a very

small place indeed.”



Mrs. Plinth bristled. “We have a great many representative people,” she

said, in the tone of one who speaks for her order.



Osric Dane turned to her thoughtfully. “What do they represent?” she

asked.



Mrs. Plinth’s constitutional dislike to being questioned was intensified

by her sense of unpreparedness; and her reproachful glance passed the

question on to Mrs. Ballinger.



“Why,” said that lady, glancing in turn at the other members, “as a

community I hope it is not too much to say that we stand for culture.”



“For art--” Miss Glyde eagerly interjected.



“For art and literature,” Mrs. Ballinger emended.



“And for sociology, I trust,” snapped Miss Van Vluyck.



“We have a standard,” said Mrs. Plinth, feeling herself suddenly secure

on the vast expanse of a generalisation: and Mrs. Leveret, thinking

there must be room for more than one on so broad a statement, took

courage to murmur: “Oh, certainly; we have a standard.”



“The object of our little club,” Mrs. Ballinger continued, “is to

concentrate the highest tendencies of Hillbridge--to centralise and

focus its complex intellectual effort.”



This was felt to be so happy that the ladies drew an almost audible

breath of relief.



“We aspire,” the President went on, “to stand for what is highest in

art, literature and ethics.”



Osric Dane again turned to her. “What ethics?” she asked.



A tremor of apprehension encircled the room. None of the ladies required

any preparation to pronounce on a question of morals; but when they

were called ethics it was different. The club, when fresh from

the “Encyclopaedia Britannica,” the “Reader’s Handbook” or Smith’s

“Classical Dictionary,” could deal confidently with any subject; but

when taken unawares it had been known to define agnosticism as a heresy

of the Early Church and Professor Froude as a distinguished histologist;

and such minor members as Mrs. Leveret still secretly regarded ethics as

something vaguely pagan.



Even to Mrs. Ballinger, Osric Dane’s question was unsettling, and there

was a general sense of gratitude when Laura Glyde leaned forward to say,

with her most sympathetic accent: “You must excuse us, Mrs. Dane, for

not being able, just at present, to talk of anything but ‘The Wings of

Death.’”



“Yes,” said Miss Van Vluyck, with a sudden resolve to carry the war into

the enemy’s camp. “We are so anxious to know the exact purpose you had

in mind in writing your wonderful book.”



“You will find,” Mrs. Plinth interposed, “that we are not superficial

readers.”



“We are eager to hear from you,” Miss Van Vluyck continued, “if

the pessimistic tendency of the book is an expression of your own

convictions or--”



“Or merely,” Miss Glyde hastily thrust in, “a sombre background brushed

in to throw your figures into more vivid relief. ARE you not primarily

plastic?”



“I have always maintained,” Mrs. Ballinger interposed, “that you

represent the purely objective method--”



Osric Dane helped herself critically to coffee. “How do you define

objective?” she then inquired.



There was a flurried pause before Laura Glyde intensely murmured: “In

reading YOU we don’t define, we feel.”



Osric Dane smiled. “The cerebellum,” she remarked, “is not infrequently

the seat of the literary emotions.” And she took a second lump of sugar.



The sting that this remark was vaguely felt to conceal was almost

neutralised by the satisfaction of being addressed in such technical

language.



“Ah, the cerebellum,” said Miss Van Vluyck complacently. “The Club took

a course in psychology last winter.”



“Which psychology?” asked Osric Dane.



There was an agonising pause, during which each member of the Club

secretly deplored the distressing inefficiency of the others. Only Mrs.

Roby went on placidly sipping her chartreuse. At last Mrs. Ballinger

said, with an attempt at a high tone: “Well, really, you know, it was

last year that we took psychology, and this winter we have been so

absorbed in--”



She broke off, nervously trying to recall some of the Club’s

discussions; but her faculties seemed to be paralysed by the petrifying

stare of Osric Dane. What HAD the club been absorbed in lately? Mrs.

Ballinger, with a vague purpose of gaining time, repeated slowly: “We’ve

been so intensely absorbed in--”



Mrs. Roby put down her liqueur glass and drew near the group with a

smile.



“In Xingu?” she gently prompted.



A thrill ran through the other members. They exchanged confused

glances, and then, with one accord, turned a gaze of mingled relief

and interrogation on their unexpected rescuer. The expression of each

denoted a different phase of the same emotion. Mrs. Plinth was the first

to compose her features to an air of reassurance: after a moment’s hasty

adjustment her look almost implied that it was she who had given the

word to Mrs. Ballinger.



“Xingu, of course!” exclaimed the latter with her accustomed promptness,

while Miss Van Vluyck and Laura Glyde seemed to be plumbing the depths

of memory, and Mrs. Leveret, feeling apprehensively for Appropriate

Allusions, was somehow reassured by the uncomfortable pressure of its

bulk against her person.



Osric Dane’s change of countenance was no less striking than that of

her entertainers. She too put down her coffee-cup, but with a look of

distinct annoyance: she too wore, for a brief moment, what Mrs. Roby

afterward described as the look of feeling for something in the back

of her head; and before she could dissemble these momentary signs of

weakness, Mrs. Roby, turning to her with a deferential smile, had said:

“And we’ve been so hoping that to-day you would tell us just what you

think of it.”



Osric Dane received the homage of the smile as a matter of course; but

the accompanying question obviously embarrassed her, and it became clear

to her observers that she was not quick at shifting her facial scenery.

It was as though her countenance had so long been set in an expression

of unchallenged superiority that the muscles had stiffened, and refused

to obey her orders.



“Xingu--” she murmured, as if seeking in her turn to gain time.



Mrs. Roby continued to press her. “Knowing how engrossing the subject

is, you will understand how it happens that the Club has let everything

else go to the wall for the moment. Since we took up Xingu I might

almost say--were it not for your books--that nothing else seems to us

worth remembering.”



Osric Dane’s stern features were darkened rather than lit up by an

uneasy smile. “I am glad to hear there is one exception,” she gave out

between narrowed lips.



“Oh, of course,” Mrs. Roby said prettily; “but as you have shown us

that--so very naturally!--you don’t care to talk about your own things,

we really can’t let you off from telling us exactly what you think about

Xingu; especially,” she added, with a persuasive smile, “as some people

say that one of your last books was simply saturated with it.”



It was an IT, then--the assurance sped like fire through the parched

minds of the other members. In their eagerness to gain the least

little clue to Xingu they almost forgot the joy of assisting at the

discomfiture of Mrs. Dane.



The latter reddened nervously under her antagonist’s direct assault.

“May I ask,” she faltered out in an embarrassed tone, “to which of my

books you refer?”



Mrs. Roby did not falter. “That’s just what I want you to tell us;

because, though I was present, I didn’t actually take part.”



“Present at what?” Mrs. Dane took her up; and for an instant the

trembling members of the Lunch Club thought that the champion Providence

had raised up for them had lost a point. But Mrs. Roby explained herself

gaily: “At the discussion, of course. And so we’re dreadfully anxious to

know just how it was that you went into the Xingu.”



There was a portentous pause, a silence so big with incalculable dangers

that the members with one accord checked the words on their lips, like

soldiers dropping their arms to watch a single combat between their

leaders. Then Mrs. Dane gave expression to their inmost dread by saying

sharply: “Ah--you say THE Xingu, do you?”



Mrs. Roby smiled undauntedly. “It IS a shade pedantic, isn’t it?

Personally, I always drop the article; but I don’t know how the other

members feel about it.”



The other members looked as though they would willingly have dispensed

with this deferential appeal to their opinion, and Mrs. Roby, after a

bright glance about the group, went on: “They probably think, as I do,

that nothing really matters except the thing itself--except Xingu.”



No immediate reply seemed to occur to Mrs. Dane, and Mrs. Ballinger

gathered courage to say: “Surely every one must feel that about Xingu.”



Mrs. Plinth came to her support with a heavy murmur of assent, and Laura

Glyde breathed emotionally: “I have known cases where it has changed a

whole life.”



“It has done me worlds of good,” Mrs. Leveret interjected, seeming

to herself to remember that she had either taken it or read it in the

winter before.



“Of course,” Mrs. Roby admitted, “the difficulty is that one must give

up so much time to it. It’s very long.”



“I can’t imagine,” said Miss Van Vluyck tartly, “grudging the time given

to such a subject.”



“And deep in places,” Mrs. Roby pursued; (so then it was a book!) “And

it isn’t easy to skip.”



“I never skip,” said Mrs. Plinth dogmatically.



“Ah, it’s dangerous to, in Xingu. Even at the start there are places

where one can’t. One must just wade through.”



“I should hardly call it WADING,” said Mrs. Ballinger sarcastically.



Mrs. Roby sent her a look of interest. “Ah--you always found it went

swimmingly?”



Mrs. Ballinger hesitated. “Of course there are difficult passages,” she

conceded modestly.



“Yes; some are not at all clear--even,” Mrs. Roby added, “if one is

familiar with the original.”



“As I suppose you are?” Osric Dane interposed, suddenly fixing her with

a look of challenge.



Mrs. Roby met it by a deprecating smile. “Oh, it’s really not difficult

up to a certain point; though some of the branches are very little

known, and it’s almost impossible to get at the source.”



“Have you ever tried?” Mrs. Plinth enquired, still distrustful of Mrs.

Roby’s thoroughness.



Mrs. Roby was silent for a moment; then she replied with lowered lids:

“No--but a friend of mine did; a very brilliant man; and he told me it

was best for women--not to...”



A shudder ran around the room. Mrs. Leveret coughed so that the

parlour-maid, who was handing the cigarettes, should not hear; Miss Van

Vluyck’s face took on a nauseated expression, and Mrs. Plinth looked as

if she were passing some one she did not care to bow to. But the most

remarkable result of Mrs. Roby’s words was the effect they produced on

the Lunch Club’s distinguished guest. Osric Dane’s impassive features

suddenly melted to an expression of the warmest human sympathy, and

edging her chair toward Mrs. Roby’s she asked: “Did he really? And--did

you find he was right?”



Mrs. Ballinger, in whom annoyance at Mrs. Roby’s unwonted assumption

of prominence was beginning to displace gratitude for the aid she had

rendered, could not consent to her being allowed, by such dubious means,

to monopolise the attention of their guest. If Osric Dane had not enough

self-respect to resent Mrs. Roby’s flippancy, at least the Lunch Club

would do so in the person of its President.



Mrs. Ballinger laid her hand on Mrs. Roby’s arm. “We must not forget,”

 she said with a frigid amiability, “that absorbing as Xingu is to US, it

may be less interesting to--”



“Oh, no, on the contrary, I assure you,” Osric Dane energetically

intervened.



“--to others,” Mrs. Ballinger finished firmly; “and we must not allow

our little meeting to end without persuading Mrs. Dane to say a few

words to us on a subject which, to-day, is much more present in all our

thoughts. I refer, of course, to ‘The Wings of Death.’”



The other members, animated by various degrees of the same sentiment,

and encouraged by the humanised mien of their redoubtable guest,

repeated after Mrs. Ballinger: “Oh, yes, you really MUST talk to us a

little about your book.”



Osric Dane’s expression became as bored, though not as haughty, as when

her work had been previously mentioned. But before she could respond

to Mrs. Ballinger’s request, Mrs. Roby had risen from her seat, and was

pulling her veil down over her frivolous nose.



“I’m so sorry,” she said, advancing toward her hostess with outstretched

hand, “but before Mrs. Dane begins I think I’d better run away.

Unluckily, as you know, I haven’t read her books, so I should be at a

terrible disadvantage among you all; and besides, I’ve an engagement to

play bridge.”



If Mrs. Roby had simply pleaded her ignorance of Osric Dane’s works as

a reason for withdrawing, the Lunch Club, in view of her recent prowess,

might have approved such evidence of discretion; but to couple this

excuse with the brazen announcement that she was foregoing the privilege

for the purpose of joining a bridge-party, was only one more instance of

her deplorable lack of discrimination.



The ladies were disposed, however, to feel that her departure--now

that she had performed the sole service she was ever likely to render

them--would probably make for greater order and dignity in the impending

discussion, besides relieving them of the sense of self-distrust which

her presence always mysteriously produced. Mrs. Ballinger therefore

restricted herself to a formal murmur of regret, and the other members

were just grouping themselves comfortably about Osric Dane when the

latter, to their dismay, started up from the sofa on which she had been

deferentially enthroned.



“Oh wait--do wait, and I’ll go with you!” she called out to Mrs. Roby;

and, seizing the hands of the disconcerted members, she administered

a series of farewell pressures with the mechanical haste of a

railway-conductor punching tickets.



“I’m so sorry--I’d quite forgotten--” she flung back at them from the

threshold; and as she joined Mrs. Roby, who had turned in surprise at

her appeal, the other ladies had the mortification of hearing her say,

in a voice which she did not take the pains to lower: “If you’ll let

me walk a little way with you, I should so like to ask you a few more

questions about Xingu...”









III





The incident had been so rapid that the door closed on the departing

pair before the other members had had time to understand what was

happening. Then a sense of the indignity put upon them by Osric Dane’s

unceremonious desertion began to contend with the confused feeling that

they had been cheated out of their due without exactly knowing how or

why.



There was an awkward silence, during which Mrs. Ballinger, with a

perfunctory hand, rearranged the skilfully grouped literature at which

her distinguished guest had not so much as glanced; then Miss Van Vluyck

tartly pronounced: “Well, I can’t say that I consider Osric Dane’s

departure a great loss.”



This confession crystallised the fluid resentment of the other members,

and Mrs. Leveret exclaimed: “I do believe she came on purpose to be

nasty!”



It was Mrs. Plinth’s private opinion that Osric Dane’s attitude toward

the Lunch Club might have been very different had it welcomed her in the

majestic setting of the Plinth drawing-rooms; but not liking to reflect

on the inadequacy of Mrs. Ballinger’s establishment she sought a

round-about satisfaction in depreciating her savoir faire.



“I said from the first that we ought to have had a subject ready. It’s

what always happens when you’re unprepared. Now if we’d only got up

Xingu--”



The slowness of Mrs. Plinth’s mental processes was always allowed for

by the Club; but this instance of it was too much for Mrs. Ballinger’s

equanimity.



“Xingu!” she scoffed. “Why, it was the fact of our knowing so much more

about it than she did--unprepared though we were--that made Osric Dane

so furious. I should have thought that was plain enough to everybody!”



This retort impressed even Mrs. Plinth, and Laura Glyde, moved by an

impulse of generosity, said: “Yes, we really ought to be grateful

to Mrs. Roby for introducing the topic. It may have made Osric Dane

furious, but at least it made her civil.”



“I am glad we were able to show her,” added Miss Van Vluyck, “that a

broad and up-to-date culture is not confined to the great intellectual

centres.”



This increased the satisfaction of the other members, and they began

to forget their wrath against Osric Dane in the pleasure of having

contributed to her defeat.



Miss Van Vluyck thoughtfully rubbed her spectacles. “What surprised me

most,” she continued, “was that Fanny Roby should be so up on Xingu.”



This frank admission threw a slight chill on the company, but Mrs.

Ballinger said with an air of indulgent irony: “Mrs. Roby always has the

knack of making a little go a long way; still, we certainly owe her a

debt for happening to remember that she’d heard of Xingu.” And this was

felt by the other members to be a graceful way of cancelling once for

all the Club’s obligation to Mrs. Roby.



Even Mrs. Leveret took courage to speed a timid shaft of irony: “I fancy

Osric Dane hardly expected to take a lesson in Xingu at Hillbridge!”



Mrs. Ballinger smiled. “When she asked me what we represented--do you

remember?--I wish I’d simply said we represented Xingu!”



All the ladies laughed appreciatively at this sally, except Mrs. Plinth,

who said, after a moment’s deliberation: “I’m not sure it would have

been wise to do so.”



Mrs. Ballinger, who was already beginning to feel as if she had

launched at Osric Dane the retort which had just occurred to her, looked

ironically at Mrs. Plinth. “May I ask why?” she enquired.



Mrs. Plinth looked grave. “Surely,” she said, “I understood from Mrs.

Roby herself that the subject was one it was as well not to go into too

deeply?”



Miss Van Vluyck rejoined with precision: “I think that applied only to

an investigation of the origin of the--of the--“; and suddenly she found

that her usually accurate memory had failed her. “It’s a part of the

subject I never studied myself,” she concluded lamely.



“Nor I,” said Mrs. Ballinger.



Laura Glyde bent toward them with widened eyes. “And yet it

seems--doesn’t it?--the part that is fullest of an esoteric

fascination?”



“I don’t know on what you base that,” said Miss Van Vluyck

argumentatively.



“Well, didn’t you notice how intensely interested Osric Dane became

as soon as she heard what the brilliant foreigner--he WAS a foreigner,

wasn’t he?--had told Mrs. Roby about the origin--the origin of the

rite--or whatever you call it?”



Mrs. Plinth looked disapproving, and Mrs. Ballinger visibly wavered.

Then she said in a decisive tone: “It may not be desirable to touch on

the--on that part of the subject in general conversation; but, from the

importance it evidently has to a woman of Osric Dane’s distinction,

I feel as if we ought not to be afraid to discuss it among

ourselves--without gloves--though with closed doors, if necessary.”



“I’m quite of your opinion,” Miss Van Vluyck came briskly to her

support; “on condition, that is, that all grossness of language is

avoided.”



“Oh, I’m sure we shall understand without that,” Mrs. Leveret tittered;

and Laura Glyde added significantly: “I fancy we can read between the

lines,” while Mrs. Ballinger rose to assure herself that the doors were

really closed.



Mrs. Plinth had not yet given her adhesion. “I hardly see,” she

began, “what benefit is to be derived from investigating such peculiar

customs--”



But Mrs. Ballinger’s patience had reached the extreme limit of tension.

“This at least,” she returned; “that we shall not be placed again in the

humiliating position of finding ourselves less up on our own subjects

than Fanny Roby!”



Even to Mrs. Plinth this argument was conclusive. She peered furtively

about the room and lowered her commanding tones to ask: “Have you got a

copy?”



“A--a copy?” stammered Mrs. Ballinger. She was aware that the other

members were looking at her expectantly, and that this answer was

inadequate, so she supported it by asking another question. “A copy of

what?”



Her companions bent their expectant gaze on Mrs. Plinth, who, in turn,

appeared less sure of herself than usual. “Why, of--of--the book,” she

explained.



“What book?” snapped Miss Van Vluyck, almost as sharply as Osric Dane.



Mrs. Ballinger looked at Laura Glyde, whose eyes were interrogatively

fixed on Mrs. Leveret. The fact of being deferred to was so new to

the latter that it filled her with an insane temerity. “Why, Xingu, of

course!” she exclaimed.



A profound silence followed this direct challenge to the resources

of Mrs. Ballinger’s library, and the latter, after glancing nervously

toward the Books of the Day, returned in a deprecating voice: “It’s not

a thing one cares to leave about.”



“I should think NOT!” exclaimed Mrs. Plinth.



“It IS a book, then?” said Miss Van Vluyck.



This again threw the company into disarray, and Mrs. Ballinger, with an

impatient sigh, rejoined: “Why--there IS a book--naturally...”



“Then why did Miss Glyde call it a religion?”



Laura Glyde started up. “A religion? I never--”



“Yes, you did,” Miss Van Vluyck insisted; “you spoke of rites; and Mrs.

Plinth said it was a custom.”



Miss Glyde was evidently making a desperate effort to reinforce her

statement; but accuracy of detail was not her strongest point. At length

she began in a deep murmur: “Surely they used to do something of the

kind at the Eleusinian mysteries--”



“Oh--” said Miss Van Vluyck, on the verge of disapproval; and Mrs.

Plinth protested: “I understood there was to be no indelicacy!”



Mrs. Ballinger could not control her irritation. “Really, it is too

bad that we should not be able to talk the matter over quietly among

ourselves. Personally, I think that if one goes into Xingu at all--”



“Oh, so do I!” cried Miss Glyde.



“And I don’t see how one can avoid doing so, if one wishes to keep up

with the Thought of the Day--”



Mrs. Leveret uttered an exclamation of relief. “There--that’s it!” she

interposed.



“What’s it?” the President curtly took her up.



“Why--it’s a--a Thought: I mean a philosophy.”



This seemed to bring a certain relief to Mrs. Ballinger and Laura Glyde,

but Miss Van Vluyck said dogmatically: “Excuse me if I tell you that

you’re all mistaken. Xingu happens to be a language.”



“A language!” the Lunch Club cried.



“Certainly. Don’t you remember Fanny Roby’s saying that there were

several branches, and that some were hard to trace? What could that

apply to but dialects?”



Mrs. Ballinger could no longer restrain a contemptuous laugh. “Really,

if the Lunch Club has reached such a pass that it has to go to Fanny

Roby for instruction on a subject like Xingu, it had almost better cease

to exist!”



“It’s really her fault for not being clearer,” Laura Glyde put in.



“Oh, clearness and Fanny Roby!” Mrs. Ballinger shrugged. “I daresay we

shall find she was mistaken on almost every point.”



“Why not look it up?” said Mrs. Plinth.



As a rule this recurrent suggestion of Mrs. Plinth’s was ignored in the

heat of discussion, and only resorted to afterward in the privacy of

each member’s home. But on the present occasion the desire to ascribe

their own confusion of thought to the vague and contradictory nature of

Mrs. Roby’s statements caused the members of the Lunch Club to utter a

collective demand for a book of reference.



At this point the production of her treasured volume gave Mrs. Leveret,

for a moment, the unusual experience of occupying the centre front; but

she was not able to hold it long, for Appropriate Allusions contained no

mention of Xingu.



“Oh, that’s not the kind of thing we want!” exclaimed Miss Van Vluyck.

She cast a disparaging glance over Mrs. Ballinger’s assortment of

literature, and added impatiently: “Haven’t you any useful books?”



“Of course I have,” replied Mrs. Ballinger indignantly; “but I keep them

in my husband’s dressing-room.”



From this region, after some difficulty and delay, the parlour-maid

produced the W-Z volume of an Encyclopaedia and, in deference to the

fact that the demand for it had come from Miss Van Vluyck, laid the

ponderous tome before her.



There was a moment of painful suspense while Miss Van Vluyck rubbed her

spectacles, adjusted them, and turned to Z; and a murmur of surprise

when she said: “It isn’t here.”



“I suppose,” said Mrs. Plinth, “it’s not fit to be put in a book of

reference.”



“Oh, nonsense!” exclaimed Mrs. Ballinger. “Try X.”



Miss Van Vluyck turned back through the volume, peering short-sightedly

up and down the pages, till she came to a stop and remained motionless,

like a dog on a point.



“Well, have you found it?” Mrs. Ballinger enquired, after a considerable

delay.



“Yes. I’ve found it,” said Miss Van Vluyck in a queer voice.



Mrs. Plinth hastily interposed: “I beg you won’t read it aloud if

there’s anything offensive.”



Miss Van Vluyck, without answering, continued her silent scrutiny.



“Well, what IS it?” exclaimed Laura Glyde excitedly.



“DO tell us!” urged Mrs. Leveret, feeling that she would have something

awful to tell her sister.



Miss Van Vluyck pushed the volume aside and turned slowly toward the

expectant group.



“It’s a river.”



“A RIVER?”



“Yes: in Brazil. Isn’t that where she’s been living?”



“Who? Fanny Roby? Oh, but you must be mistaken. You’ve been reading the

wrong thing,” Mrs. Ballinger exclaimed, leaning over her to seize the

volume.



“It’s the only XINGU in the Encyclopaedia; and she HAS been living in

Brazil,” Miss Van Vluyck persisted.



“Yes: her brother has a consulship there,” Mrs. Leveret eagerly

interposed.



“But it’s too ridiculous! I--we--why we ALL remember studying Xingu last

year--or the year before last,” Mrs. Ballinger stammered.



“I thought I did when YOU said so,” Laura Glyde avowed.



“I said so?” cried Mrs. Ballinger.



“Yes. You said it had crowded everything else out of your mind.”



“Well, YOU said it had changed your whole life!”



“For that matter, Miss Van Vluyck said she had never grudged the time

she’d given it.”



Mrs. Plinth interposed: “I made it clear that I knew nothing whatever of

the original.”



Mrs. Ballinger broke off the dispute with a groan. “Oh, what does it

all matter if she’s been making fools of us? I believe Miss Van Vluyck’s

right--she was talking of the river all the while!”



“How could she? It’s too preposterous,” Miss Glyde exclaimed.



“Listen.” Miss Van Vluyck had repossessed herself of the Encyclopaedia,

and restored her spectacles to a nose reddened by excitement. “‘The

Xingu, one of the principal rivers of Brazil, rises on the plateau of

Mato Grosso, and flows in a northerly direction for a length of no less

than one thousand one hundred and eighteen miles, entering the Amazon

near the mouth of the latter river. The upper course of the Xingu is

auriferous and fed by numerous branches. Its source was first discovered

in 1884 by the German explorer von den Steinen, after a difficult and

dangerous expedition through a region inhabited by tribes still in the

Stone Age of culture.’”



The ladies received this communication in a state of stupefied silence

from which Mrs. Leveret was the first to rally. “She certainly DID speak

of its having branches.”



The word seemed to snap the last thread of their incredulity. “And of

its great length,” gasped Mrs. Ballinger.



“She said it was awfully deep, and you couldn’t skip--you just had to

wade through,” Miss Glyde subjoined.



The idea worked its way more slowly through Mrs. Plinth’s compact

resistances. “How could there be anything improper about a river?” she

inquired.



“Improper?”



“Why, what she said about the source--that it was corrupt?”



“Not corrupt, but hard to get at,” Laura Glyde corrected. “Some

one who’d been there had told her so. I daresay it was the explorer

himself--doesn’t it say the expedition was dangerous?”



“‘Difficult and dangerous,’” read Miss Van Vluyck.



Mrs. Ballinger pressed her hands to her throbbing temples. “There’s

nothing she said that wouldn’t apply to a river--to this river!” She

swung about excitedly to the other members. “Why, do you remember her

telling us that she hadn’t read ‘The Supreme Instant’ because she’d

taken it on a boating party while she was staying with her brother,

and some one had ‘shied’ it overboard--‘shied’ of course was her own

expression?”



The ladies breathlessly signified that the expression had not escaped

them.



“Well--and then didn’t she tell Osric Dane that one of her books was

simply saturated with Xingu? Of course it was, if some of Mrs. Roby’s

rowdy friends had thrown it into the river!”



This surprising reconstruction of the scene in which they had just

participated left the members of the Lunch Club inarticulate. At length

Mrs. Plinth, after visibly labouring with the problem, said in a heavy

tone: “Osric Dane was taken in too.”



Mrs. Leveret took courage at this. “Perhaps that’s what Mrs. Roby did

it for. She said Osric Dane was a brute, and she may have wanted to give

her a lesson.”



Miss Van Vluyck frowned. “It was hardly worth while to do it at our

expense.”



“At least,” said Miss Glyde with a touch of bitterness, “she succeeded

in interesting her, which was more than we did.”



“What chance had we?” rejoined Mrs. Ballinger. “Mrs. Roby monopolised

her from the first. And THAT, I’ve no doubt, was her purpose--to give

Osric Dane a false impression of her own standing in the Club. She would

hesitate at nothing to attract attention: we all know how she took in

poor Professor Foreland.”



“She actually makes him give bridge-teas every Thursday,” Mrs. Leveret

piped up.



Laura Glyde struck her hands together. “Why, this is Thursday, and it’s

THERE she’s gone, of course; and taken Osric with her!”



“And they’re shrieking over us at this moment,” said Mrs. Ballinger

between her teeth.



This possibility seemed too preposterous to be admitted. “She would

hardly dare,” said Miss Van Vluyck, “confess the imposture to Osric

Dane.”



“I’m not so sure: I thought I saw her make a sign as she left. If she

hadn’t made a sign, why should Osric Dane have rushed out after her?”



“Well, you know, we’d all been telling her how wonderful Xingu was, and

she said she wanted to find out more about it,” Mrs. Leveret said, with

a tardy impulse of justice to the absent.



This reminder, far from mitigating the wrath of the other members, gave

it a stronger impetus.



“Yes--and that’s exactly what they’re both laughing over now,” said

Laura Glyde ironically.



Mrs. Plinth stood up and gathered her expensive furs about her

monumental form. “I have no wish to criticise,” she said; “but unless

the Lunch Club can protect its members against the recurrence of

such--such unbecoming scenes, I for one--”



“Oh, so do I!” agreed Miss Glyde, rising also.



Miss Van Vluyck closed the Encyclopaedia and proceeded to button herself

into her jacket. “My time is really too valuable--” she began.



“I fancy we are all of one mind,” said Mrs. Ballinger, looking

searchingly at Mrs. Leveret, who looked at the others.



“I always deprecate anything like a scandal--” Mrs. Plinth continued.



“She has been the cause of one to-day!” exclaimed Miss Glyde.



Mrs. Leveret moaned: “I don’t see how she COULD!” and Miss Van Vluyck

said, picking up her note-book: “Some women stop at nothing.”



“--but if,” Mrs. Plinth took up her argument impressively, “anything

of the kind had happened in MY house” (it never would have, her tone

implied), “I should have felt that I owed it to myself either to ask for

Mrs. Roby’s resignation--or to offer mine.”



“Oh, Mrs. Plinth--” gasped the Lunch Club.



“Fortunately for me,” Mrs. Plinth continued with an awful magnanimity,

“the matter was taken out of my hands by our President’s decision that

the right to entertain distinguished guests was a privilege vested in

her office; and I think the other members will agree that, as she was

alone in this opinion, she ought to be alone in deciding on the best way

of effacing its--its really deplorable consequences.”



A deep silence followed this unexpected outbreak of Mrs. Plinth’s

long-stored resentment.



“I don’t see why I should be expected to ask her to resign--” Mrs.

Ballinger at length began; but Laura Glyde turned back to remind her:

“You know she made you say that you’d got on swimmingly in Xingu.”



An ill-timed giggle escaped from Mrs. Leveret, and Mrs. Ballinger

energetically continued “--but you needn’t think for a moment that I’m

afraid to!”



The door of the drawing-room closed on the retreating backs of the

Lunch Club, and the President of that distinguished association, seating

herself at her writing-table, and pushing away a copy of “The Wings

of Death” to make room for her elbow, drew forth a sheet of the club’s

note-paper, on which she began to write: “My dear Mrs. Roby--”





The End of Xingu











THE VERDICT



June 1908





I had always thought Jack Gisburn rather a cheap genius--though a good

fellow enough--so it was no great surprise to me to hear that, in the

height of his glory, he had dropped his painting, married a rich widow,

and established himself in a villa on the Riviera. (Though I rather

thought it would have been Rome or Florence.)



“The height of his glory”--that was what the women called it. I can hear

Mrs. Gideon Thwing--his last Chicago sitter--deploring his unaccountable

abdication. “Of course it’s going to send the value of my picture ‘way

up; but I don’t think of that, Mr. Rickham--the loss to Arrt is all I

think of.” The word, on Mrs. Thwing’s lips, multiplied its RS as though

they were reflected in an endless vista of mirrors. And it was not only

the Mrs. Thwings who mourned. Had not the exquisite Hermia Croft, at the

last Grafton Gallery show, stopped me before Gisburn’s “Moon-dancers” to

say, with tears in her eyes: “We shall not look upon its like again”?



Well!--even through the prism of Hermia’s tears I felt able to face the

fact with equanimity. Poor Jack Gisburn! The women had made him--it was

fitting that they should mourn him. Among his own sex fewer regrets

were heard, and in his own trade hardly a murmur. Professional jealousy?

Perhaps. If it were, the honour of the craft was vindicated by little

Claude Nutley, who, in all good faith, brought out in the Burlington a

very handsome “obituary” on Jack--one of those showy articles stocked

with random technicalities that I have heard (I won’t say by whom)

compared to Gisburn’s painting. And so--his resolve being apparently

irrevocable--the discussion gradually died out, and, as Mrs. Thwing had

predicted, the price of “Gisburns” went up.



It was not till three years later that, in the course of a few weeks’

idling on the Riviera, it suddenly occurred to me to wonder why Gisburn

had given up his painting. On reflection, it really was a tempting

problem. To accuse his wife would have been too easy--his fair sitters

had been denied the solace of saying that Mrs. Gisburn had “dragged him

down.” For Mrs. Gisburn--as such--had not existed till nearly a year

after Jack’s resolve had been taken. It might be that he had married

her--since he liked his ease--because he didn’t want to go on painting;

but it would have been hard to prove that he had given up his painting

because he had married her.



Of course, if she had not dragged him down, she had equally, as Miss

Croft contended, failed to “lift him up”--she had not led him back to

the easel. To put the brush into his hand again--what a vocation for

a wife! But Mrs. Gisburn appeared to have disdained it--and I felt it

might be interesting to find out why.



The desultory life of the Riviera lends itself to such purely academic

speculations; and having, on my way to Monte Carlo, caught a glimpse

of Jack’s balustraded terraces between the pines, I had myself borne

thither the next day.



I found the couple at tea beneath their palm-trees; and Mrs. Gisburn’s

welcome was so genial that, in the ensuing weeks, I claimed it

frequently. It was not that my hostess was “interesting”: on that point

I could have given Miss Croft the fullest reassurance. It was just

because she was NOT interesting--if I may be pardoned the bull--that I

found her so. For Jack, all his life, had been surrounded by interesting

women: they had fostered his art, it had been reared in the hot-house

of their adulation. And it was therefore instructive to note what effect

the “deadening atmosphere of mediocrity” (I quote Miss Croft) was having

on him.



I have mentioned that Mrs. Gisburn was rich; and it was immediately

perceptible that her husband was extracting from this circumstance a

delicate but substantial satisfaction. It is, as a rule, the people who

scorn money who get most out of it; and Jack’s elegant disdain of

his wife’s big balance enabled him, with an appearance of perfect

good-breeding, to transmute it into objects of art and luxury. To the

latter, I must add, he remained relatively indifferent; but he was

buying Renaissance bronzes and eighteenth-century pictures with a

discrimination that bespoke the amplest resources.



“Money’s only excuse is to put beauty into circulation,” was one of

the axioms he laid down across the Sèvres and silver of an exquisitely

appointed luncheon-table, when, on a later day, I had again run over

from Monte Carlo; and Mrs. Gisburn, beaming on him, added for my

enlightenment: “Jack is so morbidly sensitive to every form of beauty.”



Poor Jack! It had always been his fate to have women say such things of

him: the fact should be set down in extenuation. What struck me now

was that, for the first time, he resented the tone. I had seen him, so

often, basking under similar tributes--was it the conjugal note that

robbed them of their savour? No--for, oddly enough, it became apparent

that he was fond of Mrs. Gisburn--fond enough not to see her absurdity.

It was his own absurdity he seemed to be wincing under--his own attitude

as an object for garlands and incense.



“My dear, since I’ve chucked painting people don’t say that stuff about

me--they say it about Victor Grindle,” was his only protest, as he rose

from the table and strolled out onto the sunlit terrace.



I glanced after him, struck by his last word. Victor Grindle was, in

fact, becoming the man of the moment--as Jack himself, one might put it,

had been the man of the hour. The younger artist was said to have formed

himself at my friend’s feet, and I wondered if a tinge of jealousy

underlay the latter’s mysterious abdication. But no--for it was not

till after that event that the rose Dubarry drawing-rooms had begun to

display their “Grindles.”



I turned to Mrs. Gisburn, who had lingered to give a lump of sugar to

her spaniel in the dining-room.



“Why HAS he chucked painting?” I asked abruptly.



She raised her eyebrows with a hint of good-humoured surprise.



“Oh, he doesn’t HAVE to now, you know; and I want him to enjoy himself,”

 she said quite simply.



I looked about the spacious white-panelled room, with its FAMILLE-VERTE

vases repeating the tones of the pale damask curtains, and its

eighteenth-century pastels in delicate faded frames.



“Has he chucked his pictures too? I haven’t seen a single one in the

house.”



A slight shade of constraint crossed Mrs. Gisburn’s open countenance.

“It’s his ridiculous modesty, you know. He says they’re not fit to have

about; he’s sent them all away except one--my portrait--and that I have

to keep upstairs.”



His ridiculous modesty--Jack’s modesty about his pictures? My curiosity

was growing like the bean-stalk. I said persuasively to my hostess: “I

must really see your portrait, you know.”



She glanced out almost timorously at the terrace where her husband,

lounging in a hooded chair, had lit a cigar and drawn the Russian

deerhound’s head between his knees.



“Well, come while he’s not looking,” she said, with a laugh that tried

to hide her nervousness; and I followed her between the marble Emperors

of the hall, and up the wide stairs with terra-cotta nymphs poised among

flowers at each landing.



In the dimmest corner of her boudoir, amid a profusion of delicate and

distinguished objects, hung one of the familiar oval canvases, in the

inevitable garlanded frame. The mere outline of the frame called up all

Gisburn’s past!



Mrs. Gisburn drew back the window-curtains, moved aside a JARDINIÈRE

full of pink azaleas, pushed an arm-chair away, and said: “If you stand

here you can just manage to see it. I had it over the mantel-piece, but

he wouldn’t let it stay.”



Yes--I could just manage to see it--the first portrait of Jack’s I

had ever had to strain my eyes over! Usually they had the place

of honour--say the central panel in a pale yellow or rose Dubarry

drawing-room, or a monumental easel placed so that it took the light

through curtains of old Venetian point. The more modest place became the

picture better; yet, as my eyes grew accustomed to the half-light, all

the characteristic qualities came out--all the hesitations disguised

as audacities, the tricks of prestidigitation by which, with such

consummate skill, he managed to divert attention from the real business

of the picture to some pretty irrelevance of detail. Mrs. Gisburn,

presenting a neutral surface to work on--forming, as it were, so

inevitably the background of her own picture--had lent herself in an

unusual degree to the display of this false virtuosity. The picture

was one of Jack’s “strongest,” as his admirers would have put it--it

represented, on his part, a swelling of muscles, a congesting of

veins, a balancing, straddling and straining, that reminded one of the

circus-clown’s ironic efforts to lift a feather. It met, in short, at

every point the demand of lovely woman to be painted “strongly” because

she was tired of being painted “sweetly”--and yet not to lose an atom of

the sweetness.



“It’s the last he painted, you know,” Mrs. Gisburn said with pardonable

pride. “The last but one,” she corrected herself--“but the other doesn’t

count, because he destroyed it.”



“Destroyed it?” I was about to follow up this clue when I heard a

footstep and saw Jack himself on the threshold.



As he stood there, his hands in the pockets of his velveteen coat, the

thin brown waves of hair pushed back from his white forehead, his

lean sunburnt cheeks furrowed by a smile that lifted the tips of a

self-confident moustache, I felt to what a degree he had the same

quality as his pictures--the quality of looking cleverer than he was.



His wife glanced at him deprecatingly, but his eyes travelled past her

to the portrait.



“Mr. Rickham wanted to see it,” she began, as if excusing herself. He

shrugged his shoulders, still smiling.



“Oh, Rickham found me out long ago,” he said lightly; then, passing his

arm through mine: “Come and see the rest of the house.”



He showed it to me with a kind of naive suburban pride: the bath-rooms,

the speaking-tubes, the dress-closets, the trouser-presses--all the

complex simplifications of the millionaire’s domestic economy. And

whenever my wonder paid the expected tribute he said, throwing out

his chest a little: “Yes, I really don’t see how people manage to live

without that.”



Well--it was just the end one might have foreseen for him. Only he was,

through it all and in spite of it all--as he had been through, and in

spite of, his pictures--so handsome, so charming, so disarming, that one

longed to cry out: “Be dissatisfied with your leisure!” as once one had

longed to say: “Be dissatisfied with your work!”



But, with the cry on my lips, my diagnosis suffered an unexpected check.



“This is my own lair,” he said, leading me into a dark plain room at

the end of the florid vista. It was square and brown and leathery: no

“effects”; no bric-a-brac, none of the air of posing for reproduction in

a picture weekly--above all, no least sign of ever having been used as a

studio.



The fact brought home to me the absolute finality of Jack’s break with

his old life.



“Don’t you ever dabble with paint any more?” I asked, still looking

about for a trace of such activity.



“Never,” he said briefly.



“Or water-colour--or etching?”



His confident eyes grew dim, and his cheeks paled a little under their

handsome sunburn.



“Never think of it, my dear fellow--any more than if I’d never touched a

brush.”



And his tone told me in a flash that he never thought of anything else.



I moved away, instinctively embarrassed by my unexpected discovery; and

as I turned, my eye fell on a small picture above the mantel-piece--the

only object breaking the plain oak panelling of the room.



“Oh, by Jove!” I said.



It was a sketch of a donkey--an old tired donkey, standing in the rain

under a wall.



“By Jove--a Stroud!” I cried.



He was silent; but I felt him close behind me, breathing a little

quickly.



“What a wonder! Made with a dozen lines--but on everlasting foundations.

You lucky chap, where did you get it?”



He answered slowly: “Mrs. Stroud gave it to me.”



“Ah--I didn’t know you even knew the Strouds. He was such an inflexible

hermit.”



“I didn’t--till after.... She sent for me to paint him when he was

dead.”



“When he was dead? You?”



I must have let a little too much amazement escape through my surprise,

for he answered with a deprecating laugh: “Yes--she’s an awful

simpleton, you know, Mrs. Stroud. Her only idea was to have him done by

a fashionable painter--ah, poor Stroud! She thought it the surest way

of proclaiming his greatness--of forcing it on a purblind public. And at

the moment I was THE fashionable painter.”



“Ah, poor Stroud--as you say. Was THAT his history?”



“That was his history. She believed in him, gloried in him--or thought

she did. But she couldn’t bear not to have all the drawing-rooms with

her. She couldn’t bear the fact that, on varnishing days, one could

always get near enough to see his pictures. Poor woman! She’s just a

fragment groping for other fragments. Stroud is the only whole I ever

knew.”



“You ever knew? But you just said--”



Gisburn had a curious smile in his eyes.



“Oh, I knew him, and he knew me--only it happened after he was dead.”



I dropped my voice instinctively. “When she sent for you?”



“Yes--quite insensible to the irony. She wanted him vindicated--and by

me!”



He laughed again, and threw back his head to look up at the sketch

of the donkey. “There were days when I couldn’t look at that

thing--couldn’t face it. But I forced myself to put it here; and now

it’s cured me--cured me. That’s the reason why I don’t dabble any more,

my dear Rickham; or rather Stroud himself is the reason.”



For the first time my idle curiosity about my companion turned into a

serious desire to understand him better.



“I wish you’d tell me how it happened,” I said.



He stood looking up at the sketch, and twirling between his fingers a

cigarette he had forgotten to light. Suddenly he turned toward me.



“I’d rather like to tell you--because I’ve always suspected you of

loathing my work.”



I made a deprecating gesture, which he negatived with a good-humoured

shrug.



“Oh, I didn’t care a straw when I believed in myself--and now it’s an

added tie between us!”



He laughed slightly, without bitterness, and pushed one of the deep

arm-chairs forward. “There: make yourself comfortable--and here are the

cigars you like.”



He placed them at my elbow and continued to wander up and down the room,

stopping now and then beneath the picture.



“How it happened? I can tell you in five minutes--and it didn’t take

much longer to happen.... I can remember now how surprised and pleased

I was when I got Mrs. Stroud’s note. Of course, deep down, I had always

FELT there was no one like him--only I had gone with the stream, echoed

the usual platitudes about him, till I half got to think he was a

failure, one of the kind that are left behind. By Jove, and he WAS left

behind--because he had come to stay! The rest of us had to let ourselves

be swept along or go under, but he was high above the current--on

everlasting foundations, as you say.



“Well, I went off to the house in my most egregious mood--rather moved,

Lord forgive me, at the pathos of poor Stroud’s career of failure being

crowned by the glory of my painting him! Of course I meant to do the

picture for nothing--I told Mrs. Stroud so when she began to stammer

something about her poverty. I remember getting off a prodigious phrase

about the honour being MINE--oh, I was princely, my dear Rickham! I was

posing to myself like one of my own sitters.



“Then I was taken up and left alone with him. I had sent all my traps in

advance, and I had only to set up the easel and get to work. He had been

dead only twenty-four hours, and he died suddenly, of heart disease,

so that there had been no preliminary work of destruction--his face

was clear and untouched. I had met him once or twice, years before, and

thought him insignificant and dingy. Now I saw that he was superb.



“I was glad at first, with a merely aesthetic satisfaction: glad to have

my hand on such a ‘subject.’ Then his strange life-likeness began

to affect me queerly--as I blocked the head in I felt as if he were

watching me do it. The sensation was followed by the thought: if he WERE

watching me, what would he say to my way of working? My strokes began to

go a little wild--I felt nervous and uncertain.



“Once, when I looked up, I seemed to see a smile behind his close

grayish beard--as if he had the secret, and were amusing himself by

holding it back from me. That exasperated me still more. The secret?

Why, I had a secret worth twenty of his! I dashed at the canvas

furiously, and tried some of my bravura tricks. But they failed me,

they crumbled. I saw that he wasn’t watching the showy bits--I couldn’t

distract his attention; he just kept his eyes on the hard passages

between. Those were the ones I had always shirked, or covered up with

some lying paint. And how he saw through my lies!



“I looked up again, and caught sight of that sketch of the donkey

hanging on the wall near his bed. His wife told me afterward it was the

last thing he had done--just a note taken with a shaking hand, when he

was down in Devonshire recovering from a previous heart attack. Just

a note! But it tells his whole history. There are years of patient

scornful persistence in every line. A man who had swum with the current

could never have learned that mighty up-stream stroke....



“I turned back to my work, and went on groping and muddling; then I

looked at the donkey again. I saw that, when Stroud laid in the first

stroke, he knew just what the end would be. He had possessed his

subject, absorbed it, recreated it. When had I done that with any of my

things? They hadn’t been born of me--I had just adopted them....



“Hang it, Rickham, with that face watching me I couldn’t do another

stroke. The plain truth was, I didn’t know where to put it--I HAD NEVER

KNOWN. Only, with my sitters and my public, a showy splash of colour

covered up the fact--I just threw paint into their faces.... Well, paint

was the one medium those dead eyes could see through--see straight to

the tottering foundations underneath. Don’t you know how, in talking

a foreign language, even fluently, one says half the time not what one

wants to but what one can? Well--that was the way I painted; and as he

lay there and watched me, the thing they called my ‘technique’ collapsed

like a house of cards. He didn’t sneer, you understand, poor Stroud--he

just lay there quietly watching, and on his lips, through the gray

beard, I seemed to hear the question: ‘Are you sure you know where

you’re coming out?’



“If I could have painted that face, with that question on it, I should

have done a great thing. The next greatest thing was to see that I

couldn’t--and that grace was given me. But, oh, at that minute, Rickham,

was there anything on earth I wouldn’t have given to have Stroud alive

before me, and to hear him say: ‘It’s not too late--I’ll show you how’?



“It WAS too late--it would have been, even if he’d been alive. I packed

up my traps, and went down and told Mrs. Stroud. Of course I didn’t

tell her THAT--it would have been Greek to her. I simply said I couldn’t

paint him, that I was too moved. She rather liked the idea--she’s so

romantic! It was that that made her give me the donkey. But she was

terribly upset at not getting the portrait--she did so want him ‘done’

by some one showy! At first I was afraid she wouldn’t let me off--and at

my wits’ end I suggested Grindle. Yes, it was I who started Grindle: I

told Mrs. Stroud he was the ‘coming’ man, and she told somebody else,

and so it got to be true.... And he painted Stroud without wincing; and

she hung the picture among her husband’s things....”



He flung himself down in the arm-chair near mine, laid back his head,

and clasping his arms beneath it, looked up at the picture above the

chimney-piece.



“I like to fancy that Stroud himself would have given it to me, if he’d

been able to say what he thought that day.”



And, in answer to a question I put half-mechanically--“Begin again?”

 he flashed out. “When the one thing that brings me anywhere near him is

that I knew enough to leave off?”



He stood up and laid his hand on my shoulder with a laugh. “Only the

irony of it is that I AM still painting--since Grindle’s doing it

for me! The Strouds stand alone, and happen once--but there’s no

exterminating our kind of art.”





The End of The Verdict











THE RECKONING



August, 1902









I





“The marriage law of the new dispensation will be: THOU SHALT NOT BE

UNFAITHFUL--TO THYSELF.”



A discreet murmur of approval filled the studio, and through the haze of

cigarette smoke Mrs. Clement Westall, as her husband descended from his

improvised platform, saw him merged in a congratulatory group of ladies.

Westall’s informal talks on “The New Ethics” had drawn about him an

eager following of the mentally unemployed--those who, as he had once

phrased it, liked to have their brain-food cut up for them. The talks

had begun by accident. Westall’s ideas were known to be “advanced,” but

hitherto their advance had not been in the direction of publicity. He

had been, in his wife’s opinion, almost pusillanimously careful not

to let his personal views endanger his professional standing. Of late,

however, he had shown a puzzling tendency to dogmatize, to throw down

the gauntlet, to flaunt his private code in the face of society; and the

relation of the sexes being a topic always sure of an audience, a few

admiring friends had persuaded him to give his after-dinner opinions a

larger circulation by summing them up in a series of talks at the Van

Sideren studio.



The Herbert Van Siderens were a couple who subsisted, socially, on

the fact that they had a studio. Van Sideren’s pictures were chiefly

valuable as accessories to the MISE EN SCÈNE which differentiated his

wife’s “afternoons” from the blighting functions held in long New York

drawing-rooms, and permitted her to offer their friends whiskey-and-soda

instead of tea. Mrs. Van Sideren, for her part, was skilled in making

the most of the kind of atmosphere which a lay-figure and an easel

create; and if at times she found the illusion hard to maintain, and

lost courage to the extent of almost wishing that Herbert could paint,

she promptly overcame such moments of weakness by calling in some fresh

talent, some extraneous re-enforcement of the “artistic” impression. It

was in quest of such aid that she had seized on Westall, coaxing him,

somewhat to his wife’s surprise, into a flattered participation in her

fraud. It was vaguely felt, in the Van Sideren circle, that all the

audacities were artistic, and that a teacher who pronounced marriage

immoral was somehow as distinguished as a painter who depicted

purple grass and a green sky. The Van Sideren set were tired of the

conventional color-scheme in art and conduct.



Julia Westall had long had her own views on the immorality of marriage;

she might indeed have claimed her husband as a disciple. In the early

days of their union she had secretly resented his disinclination to

proclaim himself a follower of the new creed; had been inclined to tax

him with moral cowardice, with a failure to live up to the convictions

for which their marriage was supposed to stand. That was in the

first burst of propagandism, when, womanlike, she wanted to turn her

disobedience into a law. Now she felt differently. She could hardly

account for the change, yet being a woman who never allowed her impulses

to remain unaccounted for, she tried to do so by saying that she did not

care to have the articles of her faith misinterpreted by the vulgar. In

this connection, she was beginning to think that almost every one was

vulgar; certainly there were few to whom she would have cared to intrust

the defence of so esoteric a doctrine. And it was precisely at this

point that Westall, discarding his unspoken principles, had chosen to

descend from the heights of privacy, and stand hawking his convictions

at the street-corner!



It was Una Van Sideren who, on this occasion, unconsciously focussed

upon herself Mrs. Westall’s wandering resentment. In the first place,

the girl had no business to be there. It was “horrid”--Mrs. Westall

found herself slipping back into the old feminine vocabulary--simply

“horrid” to think of a young girl’s being allowed to listen to such

talk. The fact that Una smoked cigarettes and sipped an occasional

cocktail did not in the least tarnish a certain radiant innocency which

made her appear the victim, rather than the accomplice, of her parents’

vulgarities. Julia Westall felt in a hot helpless way that something

ought to be done--that some one ought to speak to the girl’s mother. And

just then Una glided up.



“Oh, Mrs. Westall, how beautiful it was!” Una fixed her with large

limpid eyes. “You believe it all, I suppose?” she asked with seraphic

gravity.



“All--what, my dear child?”



The girl shone on her. “About the higher life--the freer expansion of

the individual--the law of fidelity to one’s self,” she glibly recited.



Mrs. Westall, to her own wonder, blushed a deep and burning blush.



“My dear Una,” she said, “you don’t in the least understand what it’s

all about!”



Miss Van Sideren stared, with a slowly answering blush. “Don’t YOU,

then?” she murmured.



Mrs. Westall laughed. “Not always--or altogether! But I should like some

tea, please.”



Una led her to the corner where innocent beverages were dispensed. As

Julia received her cup she scrutinized the girl more carefully. It was

not such a girlish face, after all--definite lines were forming under

the rosy haze of youth. She reflected that Una must be six-and-twenty,

and wondered why she had not married. A nice stock of ideas she would

have as her dower! If THEY were to be a part of the modern girl’s

trousseau--



Mrs. Westall caught herself up with a start. It was as though some one

else had been speaking--a stranger who had borrowed her own voice: she

felt herself the dupe of some fantastic mental ventriloquism. Concluding

suddenly that the room was stifling and Una’s tea too sweet, she set

down her cup, and looked about for Westall: to meet his eyes had long

been her refuge from every uncertainty. She met them now, but only,

as she felt, in transit; they included her parenthetically in a larger

flight. She followed the flight, and it carried her to a corner to which

Una had withdrawn--one of the palmy nooks to which Mrs. Van Sideren

attributed the success of her Saturdays. Westall, a moment later, had

overtaken his look, and found a place at the girl’s side. She bent

forward, speaking eagerly; he leaned back, listening, with the

depreciatory smile which acted as a filter to flattery, enabling him

to swallow the strongest doses without apparent grossness of appetite.

Julia winced at her own definition of the smile.





On the way home, in the deserted winter dusk, Westall surprised his wife

by a sudden boyish pressure of her arm. “Did I open their eyes a bit?

Did I tell them what you wanted me to?” he asked gaily.



Almost unconsciously, she let her arm slip from his. “What I wanted--?”



“Why, haven’t you--all this time?” She caught the honest wonder of his

tone. “I somehow fancied you’d rather blamed me for not talking more

openly--before-- You’ve made me feel, at times, that I was sacrificing

principles to expediency.”



She paused a moment over her reply; then she asked quietly: “What made

you decide not to--any longer?”



She felt again the vibration of a faint surprise. “Why--the wish to

please you!” he answered, almost too simply.



“I wish you would not go on, then,” she said abruptly.



He stopped in his quick walk, and she felt his stare through the

darkness.



“Not go on--?”



“Call a hansom, please. I’m tired,” broke from her with a sudden rush of

physical weariness.



Instantly his solicitude enveloped her. The room had been infernally

hot--and then that confounded cigarette smoke--he had noticed once or

twice that she looked pale--she mustn’t come to another Saturday. She

felt herself yielding, as she always did, to the warm influence of his

concern for her, the feminine in her leaning on the man in him with a

conscious intensity of abandonment. He put her in the hansom, and her

hand stole into his in the darkness. A tear or two rose, and she let

them fall. It was so delicious to cry over imaginary troubles!



That evening, after dinner, he surprised her by reverting to the subject

of his talk. He combined a man’s dislike of uncomfortable questions

with an almost feminine skill in eluding them; and she knew that if he

returned to the subject he must have some special reason for doing so.



“You seem not to have cared for what I said this afternoon. Did I put

the case badly?”



“No--you put it very well.”



“Then what did you mean by saying that you would rather not have me go

on with it?”



She glanced at him nervously, her ignorance of his intention deepening

her sense of helplessness.



“I don’t think I care to hear such things discussed in public.”



“I don’t understand you,” he exclaimed. Again the feeling that his

surprise was genuine gave an air of obliquity to her own attitude. She

was not sure that she understood herself.



“Won’t you explain?” he said with a tinge of impatience. Her eyes

wandered about the familiar drawing-room which had been the scene of so

many of their evening confidences. The shaded lamps, the quiet-colored

walls hung with mezzotints, the pale spring flowers scattered here and

there in Venice glasses and bowls of old Sèvres, recalled, she hardly

knew why, the apartment in which the evenings of her first marriage had

been passed--a wilderness of rosewood and upholstery, with a picture of

a Roman peasant above the mantel-piece, and a Greek slave in “statuary

marble” between the folding-doors of the back drawing-room. It was a

room with which she had never been able to establish any closer relation

than that between a traveller and a railway station; and now, as

she looked about at the surroundings which stood for her deepest

affinities--the room for which she had left that other room--she was

startled by the same sense of strangeness and unfamiliarity. The prints,

the flowers, the subdued tones of the old porcelains, seemed to typify a

superficial refinement that had no relation to the deeper significances

of life.



Suddenly she heard her husband repeating his question.



“I don’t know that I can explain,” she faltered.



He drew his arm-chair forward so that he faced her across the hearth.

The light of a reading-lamp fell on his finely drawn face, which had

a kind of surface-sensitiveness akin to the surface-refinement of its

setting.



“Is it that you no longer believe in our ideas?” he asked.



“In our ideas--?”



“The ideas I am trying to teach. The ideas you and I are supposed to

stand for.” He paused a moment. “The ideas on which our marriage was

founded.”



The blood rushed to her face. He had his reasons, then--she was sure now

that he had his reasons! In the ten years of their marriage, how

often had either of them stopped to consider the ideas on which it was

founded? How often does a man dig about the basement of his house to

examine its foundation? The foundation is there, of course--the house

rests on it--but one lives abovestairs and not in the cellar. It

was she, indeed, who in the beginning had insisted on reviewing the

situation now and then, on recapitulating the reasons which justified

her course, on proclaiming, from time to time, her adherence to the

religion of personal independence; but she had long ceased to feel

the need of any such ideal standards, and had accepted her marriage as

frankly and naturally as though it had been based on the primitive needs

of the heart, and needed no special sanction to explain or justify it.



“Of course I still believe in our ideas!” she exclaimed.



“Then I repeat that I don’t understand. It was a part of your theory

that the greatest possible publicity should be given to our view of

marriage. Have you changed your mind in that respect?”



She hesitated. “It depends on circumstances--on the public one is

addressing. The set of people that the Van Siderens get about them don’t

care for the truth or falseness of a doctrine. They are attracted simply

by its novelty.”



“And yet it was in just such a set of people that you and I met, and

learned the truth from each other.”



“That was different.”



“In what way?”



“I was not a young girl, to begin with. It is perfectly unfitting that

young girls should be present at--at such times--should hear such things

discussed--”



“I thought you considered it one of the deepest social wrongs that such

things never ARE discussed before young girls; but that is beside

the point, for I don’t remember seeing any young girl in my audience

to-day--”



“Except Una Van Sideren!”



He turned slightly and pushed back the lamp at his elbow.



“Oh, Miss Van Sideren--naturally--”



“Why naturally?”



“The daughter of the house--would you have had her sent out with her

governess?”



“If I had a daughter I should not allow such things to go on in my

house!”



Westall, stroking his mustache, leaned back with a faint smile. “I fancy

Miss Van Sideren is quite capable of taking care of herself.”



“No girl knows how to take care of herself--till it’s too late.”



“And yet you would deliberately deny her the surest means of

self-defence?”



“What do you call the surest means of self-defence?”



“Some preliminary knowledge of human nature in its relation to the

marriage tie.”



She made an impatient gesture. “How should you like to marry that kind

of a girl?”



“Immensely--if she were my kind of girl in other respects.”



She took up the argument at another point.



“You are quite mistaken if you think such talk does not affect young

girls. Una was in a state of the most absurd exaltation--” She broke

off, wondering why she had spoken.



Westall reopened a magazine which he had laid aside at the beginning

of their discussion. “What you tell me is immensely flattering to my

oratorical talent--but I fear you overrate its effect. I can assure you

that Miss Van Sideren doesn’t have to have her thinking done for her.

She’s quite capable of doing it herself.”



“You seem very familiar with her mental processes!” flashed unguardedly

from his wife.



He looked up quietly from the pages he was cutting.



“I should like to be,” he answered. “She interests me.”









II





If there be a distinction in being misunderstood, it was one denied to

Julia Westall when she left her first husband. Every one was ready to

excuse and even to defend her. The world she adorned agreed that John

Arment was “impossible,” and hostesses gave a sigh of relief at the

thought that it would no longer be necessary to ask him to dine.



There had been no scandal connected with the divorce: neither side

had accused the other of the offence euphemistically described as

“statutory.” The Arments had indeed been obliged to transfer their

allegiance to a State which recognized desertion as a cause for divorce,

and construed the term so liberally that the seeds of desertion were

shown to exist in every union. Even Mrs. Arment’s second marriage did

not make traditional morality stir in its sleep. It was known that she

had not met her second husband till after she had parted from the first,

and she had, moreover, replaced a rich man by a poor one. Though Clement

Westall was acknowledged to be a rising lawyer, it was generally felt

that his fortunes would not rise as rapidly as his reputation. The

Westalls would probably always have to live quietly and go out to

dinner in cabs. Could there be better evidence of Mrs. Arment’s complete

disinterestedness?



If the reasoning by which her friends justified her course was somewhat

cruder and less complex than her own elucidation of the matter, both

explanations led to the same conclusion: John Arment was impossible. The

only difference was that, to his wife, his impossibility was something

deeper than a social disqualification. She had once said, in ironical

defence of her marriage, that it had at least preserved her from

the necessity of sitting next to him at dinner; but she had not then

realized at what cost the immunity was purchased. John Arment was

impossible; but the sting of his impossibility lay in the fact that he

made it impossible for those about him to be other than himself. By

an unconscious process of elimination he had excluded from the world

everything of which he did not feel a personal need: had become, as it

were, a climate in which only his own requirements survived. This might

seem to imply a deliberate selfishness; but there was nothing deliberate

about Arment. He was as instinctive as an animal or a child. It was this

childish element in his nature which sometimes for a moment unsettled

his wife’s estimate of him. Was it possible that he was simply

undeveloped, that he had delayed, somewhat longer than is usual, the

laborious process of growing up? He had the kind of sporadic shrewdness

which causes it to be said of a dull man that he is “no fool”; and it

was this quality that his wife found most trying. Even to the naturalist

it is annoying to have his deductions disturbed by some unforeseen

aberrancy of form or function; and how much more so to the wife whose

estimate of herself is inevitably bound up with her judgment of her

husband!



Arment’s shrewdness did not, indeed, imply any latent intellectual

power; it suggested, rather, potentialities of feeling, of suffering,

perhaps, in a blind rudimentary way, on which Julia’s sensibilities

naturally declined to linger. She so fully understood her own

reasons for leaving him that she disliked to think they were not as

comprehensible to her husband. She was haunted, in her analytic moments,

by the look of perplexity, too inarticulate for words, with which he had

acquiesced to her explanations.



These moments were rare with her, however. Her marriage had been too

concrete a misery to be surveyed philosophically. If she had been

unhappy for complex reasons, the unhappiness was as real as though it

had been uncomplicated. Soul is more bruisable than flesh, and Julia was

wounded in every fibre of her spirit. Her husband’s personality seemed

to be closing gradually in on her, obscuring the sky and cutting off

the air, till she felt herself shut up among the decaying bodies of

her starved hopes. A sense of having been decoyed by some world-old

conspiracy into this bondage of body and soul filled her with despair.

If marriage was the slow life-long acquittal of a debt contracted in

ignorance, then marriage was a crime against human nature. She, for one,

would have no share in maintaining the pretence of which she had been a

victim: the pretence that a man and a woman, forced into the narrowest

of personal relations, must remain there till the end, though they

may have outgrown the span of each other’s natures as the mature tree

outgrows the iron brace about the sapling.



It was in the first heat of her moral indignation that she had met

Clement Westall. She had seen at once that he was “interested,” and had

fought off the discovery, dreading any influence that should draw her

back into the bondage of conventional relations. To ward off the peril

she had, with an almost crude precipitancy, revealed her opinions to

him. To her surprise, she found that he shared them. She was attracted

by the frankness of a suitor who, while pressing his suit, admitted that

he did not believe in marriage. Her worst audacities did not seem to

surprise him: he had thought out all that she had felt, and they had

reached the same conclusion. People grew at varying rates, and the yoke

that was an easy fit for the one might soon become galling to the other.

That was what divorce was for: the readjustment of personal relations.

As soon as their necessarily transitive nature was recognized they would

gain in dignity as well as in harmony. There would be no farther need

of the ignoble concessions and connivances, the perpetual sacrifice of

personal delicacy and moral pride, by means of which imperfect marriages

were now held together. Each partner to the contract would be on his

mettle, forced to live up to the highest standard of self-development,

on pain of losing the other’s respect and affection. The low nature

could no longer drag the higher down, but must struggle to rise, or

remain alone on its inferior level. The only necessary condition to a

harmonious marriage was a frank recognition of this truth, and a solemn

agreement between the contracting parties to keep faith with themselves,

and not to live together for a moment after complete accord had ceased

to exist between them. The new adultery was unfaithfulness to self.



It was, as Westall had just reminded her, on this understanding that

they had married. The ceremony was an unimportant concession to social

prejudice: now that the door of divorce stood open, no marriage need

be an imprisonment, and the contract therefore no longer involved any

diminution of self-respect. The nature of their attachment placed

them so far beyond the reach of such contingencies that it was easy to

discuss them with an open mind; and Julia’s sense of security made her

dwell with a tender insistence on Westall’s promise to claim his release

when he should cease to love her. The exchange of these vows seemed

to make them, in a sense, champions of the new law, pioneers in the

forbidden realm of individual freedom: they felt that they had somehow

achieved beatitude without martyrdom.



This, as Julia now reviewed the past, she perceived to have been her

theoretical attitude toward marriage. It was unconsciously, insidiously,

that her ten years of happiness with Westall had developed another

conception of the tie; a reversion, rather, to the old instinct of

passionate dependency and possessorship that now made her blood revolt

at the mere hint of change. Change? Renewal? Was that what they

had called it, in their foolish jargon? Destruction, extermination

rather--this rending of a myriad fibres interwoven with another’s being!

Another? But he was not other! He and she were one, one in the mystic

sense which alone gave marriage its significance. The new law was not

for them, but for the disunited creatures forced into a mockery of

union. The gospel she had felt called on to proclaim had no bearing on

her own case.... She sent for the doctor and told him she was sure she

needed a nerve tonic.



She took the nerve tonic diligently, but it failed to act as a sedative

to her fears. She did not know what she feared; but that made her

anxiety the more pervasive. Her husband had not reverted to the subject

of his Saturday talks. He was unusually kind and considerate, with a

softening of his quick manner, a touch of shyness in his consideration,

that sickened her with new fears. She told herself that it was because

she looked badly--because he knew about the doctor and the nerve

tonic--that he showed this deference to her wishes, this eagerness to

screen her from moral draughts; but the explanation simply cleared the

way for fresh inferences.



The week passed slowly, vacantly, like a prolonged Sunday. On Saturday

the morning post brought a note from Mrs. Van Sideren. Would dear Julia

ask Mr. Westall to come half an hour earlier than usual, as there was to

be some music after his “talk”? Westall was just leaving for his office

when his wife read the note. She opened the drawing-room door and called

him back to deliver the message.



He glanced at the note and tossed it aside. “What a bore! I shall have

to cut my game of racquets. Well, I suppose it can’t be helped. Will you

write and say it’s all right?”



Julia hesitated a moment, her hand stiffening on the chair-back against

which she leaned.



“You mean to go on with these talks?” she asked.



“I--why not?” he returned; and this time it struck her that his surprise

was not quite unfeigned. The discovery helped her to find words.



“You said you had started them with the idea of pleasing me--”



“Well?”



“I told you last week that they didn’t please me.”



“Last week? Oh--” He seemed to make an effort of memory. “I thought you

were nervous then; you sent for the doctor the next day.”



“It was not the doctor I needed; it was your assurance--”



“My assurance?”



Suddenly she felt the floor fail under her. She sank into the chair with

a choking throat, her words, her reasons slipping away from her like

straws down a whirling flood.



“Clement,” she cried, “isn’t it enough for you to know that I hate it?”



He turned to close the door behind them; then he walked toward her and

sat down. “What is it that you hate?” he asked gently.



She had made a desperate effort to rally her routed argument.



“I can’t bear to have you speak as if--as if--our marriage--were like

the other kind--the wrong kind. When I heard you there, the other

afternoon, before all those inquisitive gossiping people, proclaiming

that husbands and wives had a right to leave each other whenever they

were tired--or had seen some one else--”



Westall sat motionless, his eyes fixed on a pattern of the carpet.



“You HAVE ceased to take this view, then?” he said as she broke

off. “You no longer believe that husbands and wives ARE justified in

separating--under such conditions?”



“Under such conditions?” she stammered. “Yes--I still believe that--but

how can we judge for others? What can we know of the circumstances--?”



He interrupted her. “I thought it was a fundamental article of our

creed that the special circumstances produced by marriage were not to

interfere with the full assertion of individual liberty.” He paused a

moment. “I thought that was your reason for leaving Arment.”



She flushed to the forehead. It was not like him to give a personal turn

to the argument.



“It was my reason,” she said simply.



“Well, then--why do you refuse to recognize its validity now?”



“I don’t--I don’t--I only say that one can’t judge for others.”



He made an impatient movement. “This is mere hair-splitting. What you

mean is that, the doctrine having served your purpose when you needed

it, you now repudiate it.”



“Well,” she exclaimed, flushing again, “what if I do? What does it

matter to us?”



Westall rose from his chair. He was excessively pale, and stood before

his wife with something of the formality of a stranger.



“It matters to me,” he said in a low voice, “because I do NOT repudiate

it.”



“Well--?”



“And because I had intended to invoke it as”--



He paused and drew his breath deeply. She sat silent, almost deafened by

her heart-beats.



--“as a complete justification of the course I am about to take.”



Julia remained motionless. “What course is that?” she asked.



He cleared his throat. “I mean to claim the fulfilment of your promise.”



For an instant the room wavered and darkened; then she recovered a

torturing acuteness of vision. Every detail of her surroundings pressed

upon her: the tick of the clock, the slant of sunlight on the wall, the

hardness of the chair-arms that she grasped, were a separate wound to

each sense.



“My promise--” she faltered.



“Your part of our mutual agreement to set each other free if one or the

other should wish to be released.”



She was silent again. He waited a moment, shifting his position

nervously; then he said, with a touch of irritability: “You acknowledge

the agreement?”



The question went through her like a shock. She lifted her head to it

proudly. “I acknowledge the agreement,” she said.



“And--you don’t mean to repudiate it?”



A log on the hearth fell forward, and mechanically he advanced and

pushed it back.



“No,” she answered slowly, “I don’t mean to repudiate it.”



There was a pause. He remained near the hearth, his elbow resting on the

mantel-shelf. Close to his hand stood a little cup of jade that he had

given her on one of their wedding anniversaries. She wondered vaguely if

he noticed it.



“You intend to leave me, then?” she said at length.



His gesture seemed to deprecate the crudeness of the allusion.



“To marry some one else?”



Again his eye and hand protested. She rose and stood before him.



“Why should you be afraid to tell me? Is it Una Van Sideren?”



He was silent.



“I wish you good luck,” she said.









III





She looked up, finding herself alone. She did not remember when or how

he had left the room, or how long afterward she had sat there. The fire

still smouldered on the hearth, but the slant of sunlight had left the

wall.



Her first conscious thought was that she had not broken her word, that

she had fulfilled the very letter of their bargain. There had been no

crying out, no vain appeal to the past, no attempt at temporizing or

evasion. She had marched straight up to the guns.



Now that it was over, she sickened to find herself alive. She looked

about her, trying to recover her hold on reality. Her identity seemed to

be slipping from her, as it disappears in a physical swoon. “This is my

room--this is my house,” she heard herself saying. Her room? Her house?

She could almost hear the walls laugh back at her.



She stood up, a dull ache in every bone. The silence of the room

frightened her. She remembered, now, having heard the front door close

a long time ago: the sound suddenly re-echoed through her brain. Her

husband must have left the house, then--her HUSBAND? She no longer knew

in what terms to think: the simplest phrases had a poisoned edge. She

sank back into her chair, overcome by a strange weakness. The clock

struck ten--it was only ten o’clock! Suddenly she remembered that

she had not ordered dinner... or were they dining out that evening?

DINNER--DINING OUT--the old meaningless phraseology pursued her! She

must try to think of herself as she would think of some one else, a some

one dissociated from all the familiar routine of the past, whose wants

and habits must gradually be learned, as one might spy out the ways of a

strange animal...



The clock struck another hour--eleven. She stood up again and walked

to the door: she thought she would go up stairs to her room. HER room?

Again the word derided her. She opened the door, crossed the narrow

hall, and walked up the stairs. As she passed, she noticed Westall’s

sticks and umbrellas: a pair of his gloves lay on the hall table. The

same stair-carpet mounted between the same walls; the same old French

print, in its narrow black frame, faced her on the landing. This visual

continuity was intolerable. Within, a gaping chasm; without, the same

untroubled and familiar surface. She must get away from it before she

could attempt to think. But, once in her room, she sat down on the

lounge, a stupor creeping over her...



Gradually her vision cleared. A great deal had happened in the

interval--a wild marching and countermarching of emotions, arguments,

ideas--a fury of insurgent impulses that fell back spent upon

themselves. She had tried, at first, to rally, to organize these chaotic

forces. There must be help somewhere, if only she could master the inner

tumult. Life could not be broken off short like this, for a whim, a

fancy; the law itself would side with her, would defend her. The law?

What claim had she upon it? She was the prisoner of her own choice: she

had been her own legislator, and she was the predestined victim of

the code she had devised. But this was grotesque, intolerable--a mad

mistake, for which she could not be held accountable! The law she had

despised was still there, might still be invoked... invoked, but to what

end? Could she ask it to chain Westall to her side? SHE had been

allowed to go free when she claimed her freedom--should she show less

magnanimity than she had exacted? Magnanimity? The word lashed her with

its irony--one does not strike an attitude when one is fighting for

life! She would threaten, grovel, cajole... she would yield anything to

keep her hold on happiness. Ah, but the difficulty lay deeper! The law

could not help her--her own apostasy could not help her. She was the

victim of the theories she renounced. It was as though some giant

machine of her own making had caught her up in its wheels and was

grinding her to atoms...



It was afternoon when she found herself out-of-doors. She walked with

an aimless haste, fearing to meet familiar faces. The day was radiant,

metallic: one of those searching American days so calculated to

reveal the shortcomings of our street-cleaning and the excesses of our

architecture. The streets looked bare and hideous; everything stared

and glittered. She called a passing hansom, and gave Mrs. Van Sideren’s

address. She did not know what had led up to the act; but she found

herself suddenly resolved to speak, to cry out a warning. It was too

late to save herself--but the girl might still be told. The hansom

rattled up Fifth Avenue; she sat with her eyes fixed, avoiding

recognition. At the Van Siderens’ door she sprang out and rang the bell.

Action had cleared her brain, and she felt calm and self-possessed. She

knew now exactly what she meant to say.



The ladies were both out... the parlor-maid stood waiting for a card.

Julia, with a vague murmur, turned away from the door and lingered a

moment on the sidewalk. Then she remembered that she had not paid the

cab-driver. She drew a dollar from her purse and handed it to him.

He touched his hat and drove off, leaving her alone in the long empty

street. She wandered away westward, toward strange thoroughfares, where

she was not likely to meet acquaintances. The feeling of aimlessness had

returned. Once she found herself in the afternoon torrent of Broadway,

swept past tawdry shops and flaming theatrical posters, with a

succession of meaningless faces gliding by in the opposite direction...



A feeling of faintness reminded her that she had not eaten since

morning. She turned into a side street of shabby houses, with rows of

ash-barrels behind bent area railings. In a basement window she saw the

sign LADIES’ RESTAURANT: a pie and a dish of doughnuts lay against the

dusty pane like petrified food in an ethnological museum. She entered,

and a young woman with a weak mouth and a brazen eye cleared a table for

her near the window. The table was covered with a red and white cotton

cloth and adorned with a bunch of celery in a thick tumbler and a

salt-cellar full of grayish lumpy salt. Julia ordered tea, and sat a

long time waiting for it. She was glad to be away from the noise and

confusion of the streets. The low-ceilinged room was empty, and two or

three waitresses with thin pert faces lounged in the background staring

at her and whispering together. At last the tea was brought in a

discolored metal teapot. Julia poured a cup and drank it hastily. It was

black and bitter, but it flowed through her veins like an elixir. She

was almost dizzy with exhilaration. Oh, how tired, how unutterably tired

she had been!



She drank a second cup, blacker and bitterer, and now her mind was once

more working clearly. She felt as vigorous, as decisive, as when she had

stood on the Van Siderens’ door-step--but the wish to return there had

subsided. She saw now the futility of such an attempt--the humiliation

to which it might have exposed her... The pity of it was that she did

not know what to do next. The short winter day was fading, and she

realized that she could not remain much longer in the restaurant without

attracting notice. She paid for her tea and went out into the street.

The lamps were alight, and here and there a basement shop cast an

oblong of gas-light across the fissured pavement. In the dusk there was

something sinister about the aspect of the street, and she hastened back

toward Fifth Avenue. She was not used to being out alone at that hour.



At the corner of Fifth Avenue she paused and stood watching the stream

of carriages. At last a policeman caught sight of her and signed to her

that he would take her across. She had not meant to cross the street,

but she obeyed automatically, and presently found herself on the

farther corner. There she paused again for a moment; but she fancied the

policeman was watching her, and this sent her hastening down the nearest

side street... After that she walked a long time, vaguely... Night had

fallen, and now and then, through the windows of a passing carriage, she

caught the expanse of an evening waistcoat or the shimmer of an opera

cloak...



Suddenly she found herself in a familiar street. She stood still a

moment, breathing quickly. She had turned the corner without noticing

whither it led; but now, a few yards ahead of her, she saw the house

in which she had once lived--her first husband’s house. The blinds were

drawn, and only a faint translucence marked the windows and the transom

above the door. As she stood there she heard a step behind her, and a

man walked by in the direction of the house. He walked slowly, with a

heavy middle-aged gait, his head sunk a little between the shoulders,

the red crease of his neck visible above the fur collar of his overcoat.

He crossed the street, went up the steps of the house, drew forth a

latch-key, and let himself in...



There was no one else in sight. Julia leaned for a long time against the

area-rail at the corner, her eyes fixed on the front of the house. The

feeling of physical weariness had returned, but the strong tea still

throbbed in her veins and lit her brain with an unnatural clearness.

Presently she heard another step draw near, and moving quickly away, she

too crossed the street and mounted the steps of the house. The impulse

which had carried her there prolonged itself in a quick pressure of the

electric bell--then she felt suddenly weak and tremulous, and grasped

the balustrade for support. The door opened and a young footman with

a fresh inexperienced face stood on the threshold. Julia knew in an

instant that he would admit her.



“I saw Mr. Arment going in just now,” she said. “Will you ask him to see

me for a moment?”



The footman hesitated. “I think Mr. Arment has gone up to dress for

dinner, madam.”



Julia advanced into the hall. “I am sure he will see me--I will not

detain him long,” she said. She spoke quietly, authoritatively, in the

tone which a good servant does not mistake. The footman had his hand on

the drawing-room door.



“I will tell him, madam. What name, please?”



Julia trembled: she had not thought of that. “Merely say a lady,” she

returned carelessly.



The footman wavered and she fancied herself lost; but at that instant

the door opened from within and John Arment stepped into the hall. He

drew back sharply as he saw her, his florid face turning sallow with

the shock; then the blood poured back to it, swelling the veins on his

temples and reddening the lobes of his thick ears.



It was long since Julia had seen him, and she was startled at the change

in his appearance. He had thickened, coarsened, settled down into

the enclosing flesh. But she noted this insensibly: her one conscious

thought was that, now she was face to face with him, she must not let

him escape till he had heard her. Every pulse in her body throbbed with

the urgency of her message.



She went up to him as he drew back. “I must speak to you,” she said.



Arment hesitated, red and stammering. Julia glanced at the footman, and

her look acted as a warning. The instinctive shrinking from a “scene”

 predominated over every other impulse, and Arment said slowly: “Will you

come this way?”



He followed her into the drawing-room and closed the door. Julia, as she

advanced, was vaguely aware that the room at least was unchanged: time

had not mitigated its horrors. The contadina still lurched from the

chimney-breast, and the Greek slave obstructed the threshold of the

inner room. The place was alive with memories: they started out from

every fold of the yellow satin curtains and glided between the angles of

the rosewood furniture. But while some subordinate agency was carrying

these impressions to her brain, her whole conscious effort was centred

in the act of dominating Arment’s will. The fear that he would refuse

to hear her mounted like fever to her brain. She felt her purpose melt

before it, words and arguments running into each other in the heat of

her longing. For a moment her voice failed her, and she imagined herself

thrust out before she could speak; but as she was struggling for a word,

Arment pushed a chair forward, and said quietly: “You are not well.”



The sound of his voice steadied her. It was neither kind nor unkind--a

voice that suspended judgment, rather, awaiting unforeseen developments.

She supported herself against the back of the chair and drew a deep

breath. “Shall I send for something?” he continued, with a cold

embarrassed politeness.



Julia raised an entreating hand. “No--no--thank you. I am quite well.”



He paused midway toward the bell and turned on her. “Then may I ask--?”



“Yes,” she interrupted him. “I came here because I wanted to see you.

There is something I must tell you.”



Arment continued to scrutinize her. “I am surprised at that,” he said.

“I should have supposed that any communication you may wish to make

could have been made through our lawyers.”



“Our lawyers!” She burst into a little laugh. “I don’t think they could

help me--this time.”



Arment’s face took on a barricaded look. “If there is any question of

help--of course--”



It struck her, whimsically, that she had seen that look when some shabby

devil called with a subscription-book. Perhaps he thought she wanted him

to put his name down for so much in sympathy--or even in money...

The thought made her laugh again. She saw his look change slowly to

perplexity. All his facial changes were slow, and she remembered,

suddenly, how it had once diverted her to shift that lumbering scenery

with a word. For the first time it struck her that she had been cruel.

“There IS a question of help,” she said in a softer key: “you can help

me; but only by listening... I want to tell you something...”



Arment’s resistance was not yielding. “Would it not be easier

to--write?” he suggested.



She shook her head. “There is no time to write... and it won’t take

long.” She raised her head and their eyes met. “My husband has left me,”

 she said.



“Westall--?” he stammered, reddening again.



“Yes. This morning. Just as I left you. Because he was tired of me.”



The words, uttered scarcely above a whisper, seemed to dilate to the

limit of the room. Arment looked toward the door; then his embarrassed

glance returned to Julia.



“I am very sorry,” he said awkwardly.



“Thank you,” she murmured.



“But I don’t see--”



“No--but you will--in a moment. Won’t you listen to me? Please!”

 Instinctively she had shifted her position putting herself between

him and the door. “It happened this morning,” she went on in short

breathless phrases. “I never suspected anything--I thought we

were--perfectly happy... Suddenly he told me he was tired of me... there

is a girl he likes better... He has gone to her...” As she spoke, the

lurking anguish rose upon her, possessing her once more to the exclusion

of every other emotion. Her eyes ached, her throat swelled with it, and

two painful tears burnt a way down her face.



Arment’s constraint was increasing visibly. “This--this is very

unfortunate,” he began. “But I should say the law--”



“The law?” she echoed ironically. “When he asks for his freedom?”



“You are not obliged to give it.”



“You were not obliged to give me mine--but you did.”



He made a protesting gesture.



“You saw that the law couldn’t help you--didn’t you?” she went on.

“That is what I see now. The law represents material rights--it can’t go

beyond. If we don’t recognize an inner law... the obligation that love

creates... being loved as well as loving... there is nothing to

prevent our spreading ruin unhindered... is there?” She raised her head

plaintively, with the look of a bewildered child. “That is what I see

now... what I wanted to tell you. He leaves me because he’s tired... but

I was not tired; and I don’t understand why he is. That’s the dreadful

part of it--the not understanding: I hadn’t realized what it meant.

But I’ve been thinking of it all day, and things have come back to

me--things I hadn’t noticed... when you and I...” She moved closer to

him, and fixed her eyes on his with the gaze that tries to reach beyond

words. “I see now that YOU didn’t understand--did you?”



Their eyes met in a sudden shock of comprehension: a veil seemed to be

lifted between them. Arment’s lip trembled.



“No,” he said, “I didn’t understand.”



She gave a little cry, almost of triumph. “I knew it! I knew it! You

wondered--you tried to tell me--but no words came... You saw your life

falling in ruins... the world slipping from you... and you couldn’t

speak or move!”



She sank down on the chair against which she had been leaning. “Now I

know--now I know,” she repeated.



“I am very sorry for you,” she heard Arment stammer.



She looked up quickly. “That’s not what I came for. I don’t want you to

be sorry. I came to ask you to forgive me... for not understanding that

YOU didn’t understand... That’s all I wanted to say.” She rose with a

vague sense that the end had come, and put out a groping hand toward the

door.



Arment stood motionless. She turned to him with a faint smile.



“You forgive me?”



“There is nothing to forgive--”



“Then will you shake hands for good-by?” She felt his hand in hers: it

was nerveless, reluctant.



“Good-by,” she repeated. “I understand now.”



She opened the door and passed out into the hall. As she did so, Arment

took an impulsive step forward; but just then the footman, who was

evidently alive to his obligations, advanced from the background to let

her out. She heard Arment fall back. The footman threw open the door,

and she found herself outside in the darkness.



The End of The Reckoning











VERSE









BOTTICELLI’S MADONNA IN THE LOUVRE.





     WHAT strange presentiment, O Mother, lies

     On thy waste brow and sadly-folded lips,

     Forefeeling the Light’s terrible eclipse

     On Calvary, as if love made thee wise,

     And thou couldst read in those dear infant eyes

     The sorrow that beneath their smiling sleeps,

     And guess what bitter tears a mother weeps

     When the cross darkens her unclouded skies?



     Sad Lady, if some mother, passing thee,

     Should feel a throb of thy foreboding pain,

     And think--“My child at home clings so to me,

     With the same smile... and yet in vain, in vain,

     Since even this Jesus died on Calvary”--

     Say to her then: “He also rose again.”









THE TOMB OF ILARIA GIUNIGI.





     ILARIA, thou that wert so fair and dear

     That death would fain disown thee, grief made wise

     With prophecy thy husband’s widowed eyes

     And bade him call the master’s art to rear

     Thy perfect image on the sculptured bier,

     With dreaming lids, hands laid in peaceful guise

     Beneath the breast that seems to fall and rise,

     And lips that at love’s call should answer, “Here!”



     First-born of the Renascence, when thy soul

     Cast the sweet robing of the flesh aside,

     Into these lovelier marble limbs it stole,

     Regenerate in art’s sunrise clear and wide

     As saints who, having kept faith’s raiment whole,

     Change it above for garments glorified.









THE SONNET.



     PURE form, that like some chalice of old time

        Contain’st the liquid of the poet’s thought

        Within thy curving hollow, gem-enwrought

        With interwoven traceries of rhyme,

     While o’er thy brim the bubbling fancies climb,

        What thing am I, that undismayed have sought

        To pour my verse with trembling hand untaught

        Into a shape so small yet so sublime?

     Because perfection haunts the hearts of men,

        Because thy sacred chalice gathered up

        The wine of Petrarch, Shakspere, Shelley--then

     Receive these tears of failure as they drop

        (Sole vintage of my life), since I am fain

        To pour them in a consecrated cup.









TWO BACKGROUNDS.





     I. LA VIERGE AU DONATEUR.





     HERE  by the ample river’s argent sweep,

     Bosomed in tilth and vintage to her walls,

     A tower-crowned Cybele in armored sleep

     The city lies, fat plenty in her halls,

     With calm, parochial spires that hold in fee

     The friendly gables clustered at their base,

     And, equipoised o’er tower and market-place,

     The Gothic minster’s winged immensity;

     And in that narrow burgh, with equal mood,

     Two placid hearts, to all life’s good resigned,

     Might, from the altar to the lych-gate, find

     Long years of peace and dreamless plenitude.





     II. MONA LISA.





     Yon strange blue city crowns a scarped steep

     No mortal foot hath bloodlessly essayed;

     Dreams and illusions beacon from its keep,

     But at the gate an Angel bares his blade;

     And tales are told of those who thought to gain

     At dawn its ramparts; but when evening fell

     Far off they saw each fading pinnacle

     Lit with wild lightnings from the heaven of pain;

     Yet there two souls, whom life’s perversities

     Had mocked with want in plenty, tears in mirth,

     Might meet in dreams, ungarmented of earth,

     And drain Joy’s awful chalice to the lees.









EXPERIENCE.





     I.



     LIKE Crusoe with the bootless gold we stand

     Upon the desert verge of death, and say:

     “What shall avail the woes of yesterday

     To buy to-morrow’s wisdom, in the land

     Whose currency is strange unto our hand?

     In life’s small market they have served to pay

     Some late-found rapture, could we but delay

     Till Time hath matched our means to our demand.”



     But otherwise Fate wills it, for, behold,

     Our gathered strength of individual pain,

     When Time’s long alchemy hath made it gold,

     Dies with us--hoarded all these years in vain,

     Since those that might be heir to it the mould

     Renew, and coin themselves new griefs again.





     II.



     O, Death, we come full-handed to thy gate,

     Rich with strange burden of the mingled years,

     Gains and renunciations, mirth and tears,

     And love’s oblivion, and remembering hate,

     Nor know we what compulsion laid such freight

     Upon our souls--and shall our hopes and fears

     Buy nothing of thee, Death?  Behold our wares,

     And sell us the one joy for which we wait.

     Had we lived longer, life had such for sale,

     With the last coin of sorrow purchased cheap,

     But now we stand before thy shadowy pale,

     And all our longings lie within thy keep--

     Death, can it be the years shall naught avail?



     “Not so,” Death answered, “they shall purchase sleep.”









CHARTRES.





     I.



     IMMENSE, august, like some Titanic bloom,

        The mighty choir unfolds its lithic core,

     Petalled with panes of azure, gules and or,

        Splendidly lambent in the Gothic gloom,

     And stamened with keen flamelets that illume

        The pale high-altar.  On the prayer-worn floor,

     By surging worshippers thick-thronged of yore,

        A few brown crones, familiars of the tomb,

     The stranded driftwood of Faith’s ebbing sea--

        For these alone the finials fret the skies,

     The topmost bosses shake their blossoms free,

        While from the triple portals, with grave eyes,

     Tranquil, and fixed upon eternity,

        The cloud of witnesses still testifies.





     II.



     The crimson panes like blood-drops stigmatize

        The western floor.  The aisles are mute and cold.

     A rigid fetich in her robe of gold

        The Virgin of the Pillar, with blank eyes,

     Enthroned beneath her votive canopies,

        Gathers a meagre remnant to her fold.

     The rest is solitude; the church, grown old,

        Stands stark and gray beneath the burning skies.

     Wellnigh again its mighty frame-work grows

        To be a part of nature’s self, withdrawn

     From hot humanity’s impatient woes;

        The floor is ridged like some rude mountain lawn,

     And in the east one giant window shows

        The roseate coldness of an Alp at dawn.









LIFE.





     LIFE, like a marble block, is given to all,

     A blank, inchoate mass of years and days,

     Whence one with ardent chisel swift essays

     Some shape of strength or symmetry to call;

     One shatters it in bits to mend a wall;

     One in a craftier hand the chisel lays,

     And one, to wake the mirth in Lesbia’s gaze,

     Carves it apace in toys fantastical.



     But least is he who, with enchanted eyes

     Filled with high visions of fair shapes to be,

     Muses which god he shall immortalize

     In the proud Parian’s perpetuity,

     Till twilight warns him from the punctual skies

     That the night cometh wherein none shall see.









AN AUTUMN SUNSET





     I



     LEAGUERED in fire

     The wild black promontories of the coast extend

     Their savage silhouettes;

     The sun in universal carnage sets,

     And, halting higher,

     The motionless storm-clouds mass their sullen threats,

     Like an advancing mob in sword-points penned,

     That, balked, yet stands at bay.

     Mid-zenith hangs the fascinated day

     In wind-lustrated hollows crystalline,

     A wan valkyrie whose wide pinions shine

     Across the ensanguined ruins of the fray,

     And in her lifted hand swings high o’erhead,

     Above the waste of war,

     The silver torch-light of the evening star

     Wherewith to search the faces of the dead.





     II



     Lagooned in gold,

     Seem not those jetty promontories rather

     The outposts of some ancient land forlorn,

     Uncomforted of morn,

     Where old oblivions gather,

     The melancholy, unconsoling fold

     Of all things that go utterly to death

     And mix no more, no more

     With life’s perpetually awakening breath?

     Shall Time not ferry me to such a shore,

     Over such sailless seas,

     To walk with hope’s slain importunities

     In miserable marriage?  Nay, shall not

     All things be there forgot,

     Save the sea’s golden barrier and the black

     Closecrouching promontories?

     Dead to all shames, forgotten of all glories,

     Shall I not wander there, a shadow’s shade,

     A spectre self-destroyed,

     So purged of all remembrance and sucked back

     Into the primal void,

     That should we on that shore phantasmal meet

     I should not know the coming of your feet?

Naturally human work was more creative, more inspiring, more important

than robot drudgery. Naturally it was the most important task in all the

world ... or was it?









THE REAL HARD SELL



By William W. Stuart





Ben Tilman sat down in the easiest of all easy chairs. He picked up a

magazine, flipped pages; stood up, snapped fingers; walked to the view

wall, walked back; sat down, picked up the magazine.



He was waiting, near the end of the day, after hours, in the lush, plush

waiting room--""The customer's ease is the Sales Manager's please""--to

see the Old Man. He was fidgety, but not about something. About nothing.

He was irritated at nobody, at the world; at himself.



He was irritated at himself because there was no clear reason for him to

be irritated at anything.



There he sat, Ben Tilman, normally a cheerful, pleasant young man. He

was a salesman like any modern man and a far better salesman than most.

He had a sweet little wife, blonde and pretty. He had a fine, husky

two-year-old boy, smart, a real future National Sales Manager. He loved

them both. He had every reason to be contented with his highly

desirable, comfortable lot.



And yet he had been getting more sour and edgy ever since about six

months after the baby came home from the Center and the novelty of

responsibility for wife and child had worn off. He had now quit three

jobs, good enough sales jobs where he was doing well, in a year. For no

reason? For petty, pointless reasons.



With Ancestral Insurance, ""Generations of Protection,"" he'd made the

Billion Dollar Club--and immediately begun to feel dissatisfied with

it--just before cute, sexy, blonde Betty had suddenly come from nowhere

into his life and he had married her. That had helped, sure. But as soon

after that as he had started paying serious attention to his job again,

he was fed up with it. ""Too much paper work. All those forms. It's work

for a robot, not a man,"" he'd told Betty when he quit. A lie. The paper

work was, as he looked back on it, not bad at all; pleasant even, in a

way. It was just--nothing. Anything.



Indoor-Outdoor Climatizers--sniffles, he said, kept killing his sales

presentation even though his record was good enough. Ultra-sonic

toothbrushes, then, were a fine product. Only the vibration, with his

gold inlay, seemed to give him headaches after every demonstration. He

didn't _have_ a gold inlay. But the headaches were real enough. So he

quit.



So now he had a great new job with a great organization, Amalgamated

Production for Living--ALPRODLIV. He was about to take on his first big

assignment.



For that he had felt a spark of the old enthusiasm and it had carried

him into working out a bright new sales approach for the deal tonight.

The Old Man himself had taken a personal interest, which was a terrific

break. And still Ben Tilman felt that uneasy dissatisfaction. Damn.



""Mr. Robb will see you now, Mr. Tilman,"" said the cool robot voice from

the Elec-Sec Desk. It was after customer hours and the charming human

receptionist had gone. The robot secretary, like most working robots,

was functional in form--circuits and wires, mike, speaker, extension

arms to type and to reach any file in the room, wheels for intra-office

mobility.



""Thanks, hon,"" said Ben. Nevertheless, robot secretaries were all

programmed and rated female--and it was wise to be polite to them. After

all, they could think and had feelings. There were a lot of important

things they could do for a salesman--or, sometimes, not do. This one,

being helpful, stretched out a long metal arm to open the door to the

inner office for Ben. He smiled his appreciation and went in.



       *       *       *       *       *



The Old Man, Amalgamated's grand old salesman, was billiard bald, aging,

a little stout and a little slower now. But he was still a fine sales

manager. He sat at his huge, old fashioned oak desk as Ben walked across

the office.



""Evening, sir."" No response. Louder, ""Good evening, Mr. Robb. Mr. Robb,

it's Ben, sir. Ben Tilman. You memo'd me to come--"" Still no sign. The

eyes, under the great, beetling brows, seemed closed.



Ben grinned and reached out across the wide desk toward the small,

plastic box hanging on the Old Man's chest. The Old Man glanced up as

Ben tapped the plastic lightly with his fingernail.



""Oh, Ben. It's you."" The Old Man raised his hand to adjust the ancient

style hearing aid he affected as Ben sank into a chair. ""Sorry Ben. I

just had old Brannic Z-IX in here. A fine old robot, yes, but like most

of that model, long-winded. So--"" He gestured at the hearing aid.



Ben smiled. Everyone knew the Old Man used that crude old rig so he

could pointedly tune out conversations he didn't care to hear. Any time

you were talking to him and that distant look came into his half closed

eyes, you could be sure that you were cut off.



""Sorry, Ben. Well now. I simply wanted to check with you, boy.

Everything all set for tonight?""



""Well, yes, sir. Everything is set and programmed. Betty and I will play

it all evening for the suspense, let them wonder, build it up--and then,

instead of the big pitch they'll be looking for, we'll let it go easy.""



""A new twist on the old change-up. Ben, boy, it's going to go. I feel

it. It's in the air, things are just ripe for a new, super-soft-sell

pitch. Selling you've got to do by feel, eh Ben? By sales genius and the

old seat of the pants. Good. After tonight I'm going all out, a

hemisphere-wide, thirty day campaign. I'll put the top sales artist of

every regional office on it. They can train on your test pattern tapes.

I believe we can turn over billions before everybody picks up the signal

and it senilesces. You give an old man a new faith in sales, Ben! You're

a _salesman_.""



""Well, sir--"" But the Old Man's knack with the youthful-enthusiasm

approach was contagious. For the moment Ben caught it and he felt pretty

good about the coming night's work. He and Betty together would put the

deal over. That would be something.



Sure it would...



""How do you and your wife like the place, Ben?"" It was some place, for

sure, the brand new house that Amalgamated had installed Ben, Betty and

Bennie in the day after he had signed up.



""It's--uh--just fine, sir. Betty likes it very much, really. We both

do."" He hoped his tone was right.



""Good, Ben. Well, be sure to stop by in the morning. I'll have the

tapes, of course, but I'll want your analysis. Might be a little

vacation bonus in it for you, too.""



""Sir, I don't know how to thank you.""



The Old Man waved a hand. ""Nothing you won't have earned, my boy. Robots

can't sell."" That was the set dismissal.



""Yes, sir. Robots can't manage sales, or--"" He winked. The Old Man

chuckled. An old joke was never too old for the Old Man. The same old

bromides every time; and the same hearty chuckle. Ben left on the end of

it.



       *       *       *       *       *



Dialing home on his new, Company-owned, convertible soar-kart, he felt

not too bad. Some of the old lift in spirits came as the kart-pilot

circuits digested the directions, selected a route and zipped up into a

north-north-west traffic pattern. The Old Man was a wonderful sales

manager and boss. The new house-warming pitch that he and Betty would

try tonight was smart. He could feel he had done something.



Exercising his sales ability with fair success, he fed himself this

pitch all along the two hundred mile, twenty-minute hop home from the

city. The time and distance didn't bother him. ""Gives me time to think,""

he had told Betty. Whether or not this seemed to her an advantage, she

didn't say. At least she liked the place, ""Amalgamated's Country

Gentleman Estate--Spacious, Yet fully Automated.""



""We are,"" the Old Man told Ben when he was given the Company-assigned

quarters, ""starting a new trend. With the terrific decline in birth rate

during the past 90 to 100 years, you'll be astonished at how much room

there is out there. No reason for everyone to live in the suburban

centers any more. With millions of empty apartments in them, high time

we built something else, eh? Trouble with people today, no initiative in

obsolescing. But we'll move them.""



Home, Ben left the kart out and conveyed up the walk. The front door

opened. Betty had been watching for him. He walked to the family

vueroom, as usual declining to convey in the house. The hell with the

conveyor's feelings, if so simple a robot really had any. He _liked_ to

walk.



""Color pattern,"" Betty ordered the vuescreen as he came in, ""robot audio

out."" With people talking in the house it was still necessary to put the

machines under master automatic and manual control. Some of the less

sophisticated robots might pick up some chance phrase of conversation

and interpret it as an order if left on audio.



""Ben,"" said Betty, getting up to meet him, ""you're late.""



Ben was too good a salesman to argue that. Instead, he took her in his

arms and kissed her. It was a very good sixty seconds later that she

pushed him away with a severeness destroyed by a blush and a giggle to

say, ""Late but making up for lost time, huh? And sober, too. You must be

feeling good for a change.""



""Sure--and you feel even better, sugar."" He reached for her again. She

slipped away from him, laughing, but his wrist tel-timer caught on the

locket she always wore, her only memento from her parents, dead in the

old moon-orb crash disaster. She stood still, slightly annoyed, as he

unhooked and his mood was, not broken, but set back a little. ""What's

got into you tonight anyway, Ben?""



""Oh, I don't know. Did I tell you, the O.M. may give us a vacation?

Remember some of those nights up at that new 'Do It Yourself' Camp last

summer?""



""Ben!"" She blushed, smiled. ""We won't get any vacation if we blow our

house-warming pitch tonight, you know. And we have three couples due

here in less than a half hour. Besides, I have to talk to you about

Nana.""



       *       *       *       *       *



""That damned new CD-IX model. Now what?""



""She's very upset about Bennie. I'm not sure I blame her. This afternoon

he simply refused his indoctrination. All the time he should have been

playing store with Playmate he insisted on _drawing_ things--himself,

mind you, not Playmate. On the walls, with an old pencil of yours he

found someplace in your things. Nana couldn't do a thing with him. She

says you've got to give him a spanking.""



""Why me? Why not you?""



""Now Ben, we've been over that and over it. Discipline is the father's

job.""



""Well, I won't do it. Bennie's just a baby. Let him do a few things

himself. Won't hurt him.""



""Ben!""



""That Nana is an officious busybody, trying to run our lives.""



""Oh, Ben! You know Nana loves little Bennie. She only wants to help

him.""



""But to what?""



""She'd never dream of lifting a finger against Bennie no matter what he

did. And she lives in terror that he'll cut her switch in some temper

tantrum.""



""Hmph! Well, I'm going up right now and tell her if I hear another word

from her about spanking Bennie, I'll cut her switch myself. Then she can

go back to Central for reprogramming and see how she likes it.""



""Ben! You wouldn't.""



""Why not? Maybe she needs a new personality?""



""You won't say a thing to her. You're too soft-hearted.""



""This time I won't be.""



This time he wasn't. He met Nana CD-IX in the hallway outside Bennie's

room. Like all nurse, teaching, and children's personal service robots,

she was human in form, except for her control dial safely out of baby's

reach, top, center.



The human form was reassuring to children, kept them from feeling

strange with parents back. Nana was big, gray-haired, stout, buxom,

motherly, to reassure parents.



""Now, Mr. Tilman,"" she said with weary impatience, ""you are too late.

Surely you don't intend to burst in and disturb your son now.""



""Surely I do.""



""But he is having his supper. You will upset him. Can't you understand

that you should arrange to be here between 5:30 and 6 if you wish to

interview the child?""



""Did he miss me? Sorry, I couldn't make it earlier. But now I am going

to see him a minute.""



""Mr. Tilman!""



""Nana! And what's this about your wanting Bennie spanked because he drew

a few pictures?""



""Surely you realize these are the child's formative years, Mr. Tilman.

He should be learning to think in terms of selling now--not _doing_

things. That's robot work, Mr. Tilman. Robots can't sell, you know, and

what will people, let alone robots think if you let your boy grow up--""



       *       *       *       *       *



""He's growing up fine; and I am going in to see him.""



""Mr. Tilman!""



""_And_ for two credits, Nana, I'd cut your switch. You hear me?""



""Mr. Tilman--no! No, please. I'm sorry. Let the boy scrawl a bit;

perhaps it won't hurt him. Go in and see him if you must, but do try not

to upset him or-- All right, all right. But please Mr. Tilman, my

switch--""



""Very well Nana. I'll leave it. This time.""



""Thank you, Mr. Tilman.""



""So we understand each other, Nana. Though, matter of fact, I'm hanged

if I ever did quite see why you senior-level robots get so worked up

about your identities.""



""Wouldn't you, Mr. Tilman?""



""Of course. But--well, yes, I suppose I do see, in a way. Let's go see

Bennie-boy.""



So Ben Tilman went into the nursery and enjoyed every second of a fast

fifteen-minute roughhouse with his round-faced, laughing, chubby son and

heir. No doubt it was very bad, just after supper. But Nana, with a

rather humanly anxious restraint, confined herself to an unobtrusive

look of disapproval.



He left Bennie giggling and doubtless upset, at least to a point of

uneagerness for Nana's bedtime story about Billie the oldtime newsboy,

who sold the Brooklyn Bridge.



So then he was run through a fast ten-minute shower, shave and change by

Valet. He floated downstairs just as Betty came out of the cocktail

lounge to say, ""Code 462112 on the approach indicator. Must be the

Stoddards. They always get every place first, in time for an extra

drink.""



""Fred and Alice, yes. But damn their taste for gin, don't let Barboy

keep the cork in the vermouth all evening. I like a touch of vermouth. I

wonder if maybe I shouldn't--""



""No, you shouldn't mix the cocktails yourself and scandalize everybody.

You know perfectly well Barboy really does do better anyway.""



""Well, maybe. Everything all set, hon? Sorry I was late.""



""No trouble here. I just fed Robutler the base program this morning and

spent the rest of the day planning my side of our Sell. How to tantalize

the girls, pique the curiosity without giving it away. But you know--""

she laughed a little ruefully--""I sort of miss not having even the

shopping to do. Sometimes it hardly seems as though you need a wife at

all.""



Ben slid an arm around her waist. ""Selling isn't the only thing robots

can't do, sugar."" He pulled her close.



""Ben! They're at the door.""



They were, and then in the door, oh-ing and ah-ing over this and that.

And complimenting Barboy on the martinis. Then the Wilsons came and the

Bartletts and that was it.



""Three couples will be right,"" Ben had analyzed it. ""Enough so we can

let them get together and build up each others' curiosity but not too

many for easy control. People that don't know us so well they might be

likely to guess the gimmick. We'll let them stew all evening while they

enjoy the Country Gentleman House-Warming hospitality. Then, very

casually, we toss it out and let it lie there in front of them. They

will be sniffing, ready to nibble. The clincher will drive them right

in. I'd stake my sales reputation on it."" If it matters a damn, he

added. But silently.



They entertained three couples at their house-warming party. It was a

delightful party, a credit to Ben, Betty and the finest built-in house

robots the mind of Amalgamated could devise.



By ten o'clock they had dropped a dozen or more random hints, but never

a sales pitch. Suspense was building nicely when Betty put down an empty

glass and unobtrusively pushed the button to cue Nana. Perfect timing.

They apologized to the guests, ""We're ashamed to be so old-fashioned but

we feel better if we look in on the boy when he wakes in the night. It

keeps him from forgetting us.""



Then they floated off upstairs together, ostensibly to see Nana and

little Bennie.



Fred Stoddard: ""Some place they have here, eh? Off-beat. A little too

advanced for my taste, this single dwelling idea, but maybe--Ben sure

must have landed something juicy with Amalgamated to afford this. What

the devil is he pushing, anyway?""



Scoville Wilson (shrug): ""Beats me. You know, before dinner I cornered

him at the bar to see if I could slip in a word or two of sell. Damned

if he didn't sign an order for my Cyclo-sell Junior Tape Library without

even a C level resistance. Then he talked a bit about the drinks and I

thought sure he was pushing that new model Barboy. I was all set to come

back with a sincere 'think it over'--and then he took a bottle from the

Barboy, added a dash of vermouth to his drink and walked off without a

word of sell. He always was an odd one.""



Lucy Wilson (turns from woman talk with the other two wives): ""Oh no! I

knew it wasn't the Barboy set. They wouldn't have him set so slow.

Besides didn't you hear the way she carried on about the nursery and

that lovely Nana? That must have been a build-up, but Ben goofed his

cue to move in on Sco and me for a close. Doesn't Amalgamated handle

those nurseries?""



Tom Bartlett: ""Amalgamated makes almost anything. That's the puzzle. I

dunno--but it must be something big. He has to hit us with something,

doesn't he?""



Belle Bartlett: ""Who ever heard of a party without a sell?""



Nancy Stoddard: ""Who ever heard of a party going past ten without at

least a warm-up pitch? And Betty promised Fred to send both Ben and

Bennie to the Clinic for their Medchecks. You know we have the newest,

finest diagnosticians--""



Fred Stoddard: ""Nancy!""



Nancy Stoddard: ""Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't be selling you folks at

_their_ party, should I? Come to think, you're all signed with Fred

anyway, aren't you? Well, about Ben, _I_ think--""



Lucy Wilson: ""Sh-h-h! Here they come.""



       *       *       *       *       *



Smiling, charming--and still not an order form in sight--Ben and Betty

got back to their guests. Another half hour. Barboy was passing around

with nightcaps. Lucy Wilson nervously put a reducegar to her

sophisticated, peppermint-striped lips.



Quickly Ben Tilman was on his feet. He pulled a small, metal cylinder

from his pocket with a flourish and held it out on his open palm toward

Lucy. A tiny robot Statue of Liberty climbed from the cylinder, walked

across Ben's hand, smiled, curtsied and reached out to light the

reducegar with her torch, piping in a high, thin voice, ""Amalgamated

reducegars are cooler, lighter, finer.""



""Ben! How simply darling!""



""Do you like it? It's a new thing from Amalgamated NovelDiv. You can

program it for up to a hundred selective sell phrases, audio or visio

key. Every salesman should have one. Makes a marvelous gift, and

surprisingly reasonable.""



""So that's it, Ben. I just love it!""



""Good! It's yours, compliments of Amalgamated.""



""But--then you're not selling them? Well, what on earth--?""



""Damn it, Ben,"" Fred Stoddard broke in, ""come on, man, out with it. What

in hell _are_ you selling? You've given us the shakes. What is it? The

Barboy set? It's great. If I can scrape up the down payment, I'll--""



""_After_ we furnish a nursery with a decent Nana, Fred Stoddard,"" Nancy

snapped, ""and get a second soar-kart. Ben isn't selling Barboys anyway,

are you. Ben? It _is_ that sweet, sweet Nana, isn't it? And I do want

one, the whole nursery, Playmate and all, girl-programmed of course,

for our Polly.""



""_Is_ it the nursery, Betty?"" Lucy pitched in her credit's worth. ""Make

him tell us, darling. We have enjoyed everything so much, the dinner,

the Tri-deo, this whole lovely, lovely place of yours. Certainly the

house warming has been perfectly charming.""



""And that's it,"" said Ben smiling, a sheaf of paper forms suddenly in

his hand.



""What? Not--?""



""The house, yes. Amalgamated's Country Gentleman Estate, complete,

everything in it except Bennie, Betty and me. Your equity in your Center

co-op can serve as down payment, easy three-generation terms, issue

insurance. Actually, I can show you how, counting in your entertainment,

vacation, incidental, and living expenses, the Country Gentleman will

honestly cost you less.""



""Ben!""



""How simply too clever!""



Ben let it rest there. It was enough. Fred Stoddard, after a short

scuffle with Scoville Wilson for the pen, signed the contract with a

flourish. Sco followed.



""There!""



""There now, Ben,"" said Betty, holding Bennie a little awkwardly in her

arms in the soar-kart. They had moved out so the Stoddards could move

right in. Now they were on their way in to their reserved suite at

Amalgamated's Guest-ville. ""You were absolutely marvellous. Imagine

selling all three of them!""



""There wasn't anything to it, actually.""



""Ben, how can you say that? Nobody else could have done it. It was a

sales masterpiece. And just think. Now salesmen all over the hemisphere

are going to follow your sales plan. Doesn't it make you proud? Happy?

Ben, you aren't going to be like _that_ again?""



No, of course he wasn't. He was pleased and proud. Anyway, the Old Man

would be, and that, certainly, was something. A man had to feel good

about winning the approval of Amalgamated's grand Old Man. And it did

seem to make Betty happy.



But the actual selling of the fool house and even the two other,

identical houses on the other side of the hill--he just couldn't seem to

get much of a glow over it. He had done it; and what had he done? It was

the insurance and the toothbrushes all over again, and the old nervous,

sour feeling inside.



""At least we do have a vacation trip coming out of it, hon. The O.M.

practically promised it yesterday, if our sell sold. We could--""



""--go back to that queer new 'Do It Yourself' camp up on the lake you

insisted on dragging me to the last week of our vacation last summer.

Ben, really!"" He _was_ going to be like that. She knew it.



""Well, even you admitted it was some fun.""



""Oh, sort of, I suppose. For a little while. Once you got used to the

whole place without one single machine that could think or do even the

simplest little thing by itself. So, well, almost like being savages. Do

you think it would be safe for Bennie? We can't watch him all the time,

you know.""



""People used to manage in the old days. And remember those people, the

Burleys, who were staying up there?""



""That queer, crazy bunch who went there for a vacation when the Camp was

first opened and then just stayed? Honestly, Ben! Surely you're not

thinking of--""



""Oh, nothing like that. Just a vacation. Only--""



Only those queer, peculiar people, the Burleys had seemed so relaxed and

cheerful. Grandma and Ma Burley cleaning, washing, cooking on the

ancient electric stove; little Donnie, being a nuisance, poking at the

keys on his father's crude, manual typewriter, a museum piece; Donnie

and his brothers wasting away childhood digging and piling sand on the

beach, paddling a boat and actually building a play house. It was mad.

People playing robots. And yet, they seemed to have a wonderful time

while they were doing it.



""But how do you keep staying here?"" he had asked Buck Burley, ""Why don't

they put you out?""



""Who?"" asked Buck. ""How? Nobody can sell me on leaving. We like it here.

No robot can force us out. Here we are. Here we stay.""



       *       *       *       *       *



They pulled into the Guest-ville ramp. Bennie was fussy; the nursery

Nana was strange to him. On impulse, Betty took him in to sleep in their

room, ignoring the disapproving stares of both the Nana and the Roboy

with their things.



They were tired, let down. They went to bed quietly.



In the morning Betty was already up when Ben stumbled out of bed. ""Hi,""

she said, nervously cheerful. ""The house Nanas all had overload this

morning and I won't stand for any of those utility components with

Bennie. So I'm taking care of him myself.""



Bennie chortled and drooled vita-meal at his high-chair, unreprimanded.

Ben mustered a faint smile and turned to go dial a shave, cool shower

and dress at Robather.



That done, he had a bite of breakfast. He felt less than top-sale, but

better. Last night _had_ gone well. The Old Man would give them a

pre-paid vacation clearance to any resort in the world or out. Why

gloom?



He rubbed Bennie's unruly hair, kissed Betty and conveyed over from

Guest-ville to office.



Message-sec, in tone respect-admiration A, told him the Old Man was

waiting for him. Susan, the human receptionist in the outer office,

favored him with a dazzling smile. There was a girl who could sell; and

had a product of her own, too.



The Old Man was at his big, oak desk but, a signal honor, he got up and

came half across the room to grab Ben's hand and shake it. ""Got the full

report, son. Checked the tapes already. That's selling, boy! I'm proud

of you. Tell you what, Ben. Instead of waiting for a sales slack, I'm

going to move you and that sweet little wife of yours right into a

spanking new, special Country Gentleman unit I had in mind for myself.

And a nice, fat boost in your credit rating has already gone down to

accounting. Good? Good. Now, Ben, I have a real, artistic sales

challenge that is crying for your talent.""



""Sir? Thank you. But, sir, there is the matter of the vacation--""



[Illustration]



""Vacation? Sure, Ben. Take a vacation anytime. But right now it seems to

the Old Man you're on a hot selling streak. I don't want to see you get

off the track, son; your interests are mine. And wait till you get

your teeth into this one. Books, Ben boy. Books! People are spending all

their time sitting in on Tri-deo, not reading. People should read more,

Ben. Gives them that healthy tired feeling. Now we have the product. We

have senior Robo-writers with more circuits than ever before. All

possible information, every conceivable plot. Maybe a saturation guilt

type campaign to start--but it's up to you, Ben. I don't care how you do

it, but move books.""



""Books, eh? Well, now."" Ben was interested. ""Funny thing, sir, but that

ties in with something I was thinking about just last night.""



""You have an angle? Good boy!""



""Yes, sir. Well, it is a wild thought maybe, but last summer when I was

on vacation I met a man up at that new camp and--well, I know it sounds

silly, but he was writing a book.""



""Nonsense!""



""Just what I thought, sir. But I read some of it and, I don't know, it

had a sort of a feel about it. Something new, sir, it might catch on.""



""All right, all right. That's enough. You're a salesman. You've sold

me.""



""On the book?"" Ben was surprised.



""Quit pulling an old man's leg, Ben. I'm sold on your needing a

vacation. I'll fill out your vacation pass right now."" The Old Man,

still a vigorous, vital figure, turned and walked back to his Desk-sec.

""Yes sir,"" said the secretarial voice, ""got it. Vacation clearance for

Tilman, Ben, any resort.""



""And family,"" said Ben.



""And family. Very good, sir.""



The Old Man made his sign on the pass and said heavily, ""All right then,

Ben. That's it. Maybe if you go back up to that place for a few days and

see that psycho who was writing a book again, perhaps you'll realize how

impractical it is.""



""But sir! I'm serious about that book. It really did have--"" he broke

off.



The Old Man was sitting there, face blank, withdrawn. Ben could feel he

wasn't even listening. That damned hearing aid of his. The Old Man had

cut it off. Suddenly, unreasoningly, Ben was furious. He stood by the

huge desk and he reached across toward the hearing aid on the Old Man's

chest to turn up the volume. The Old Man looked up and saw Ben's hand

stretching out.



A sudden look of fear came into his china blue, clear eyes but he made

no move. He sat frozen in his chair.



Ben hesitated a second. ""What--?"" But he didn't have to ask. He knew.



And he also knew what he was going to do.



""No!"" said the Old Man. ""No, Ben. I've only been trying to help; trying

to serve your best interests the best way I know. Ben, you mustn't--""



But Ben moved forward.



       *       *       *       *       *



He took the plastic box on the Old Man's chest and firmly cut the

switch.



The Old Man, the Robot Old Man, went lifeless and slumped back in his

chair as Ben stretched to cut off the Desk-sec. Then he picked up his

vacation clearance.



""Robots can't sell, eh?"" he said to the dead machine behind the desk.

""Well, you couldn't sell me that time, could you, Old Man?""



Clumsily, rustily, Ben whistled a cheerful little off-key tune to

himself. Hell, they could do anything at all--except sell.



""You can't fool some of the people all of the time,"" he remarked over

his shoulder to the still, silent figure of the Old Man as he left the

office, ""it was a man said that."" He closed the door softly behind him.



Betty would be waiting.



Betty was waiting. Her head ached as she bounced Bennie, the child of

Ben, of herself and of an unknown egg cell from an anonymous ovary, on

her knees. Betty 3-RC-VIII, secret, wife-style model, the highest

development of the art of Robotics had known instantly when Ben cut the

Old Man's switch. She had half expected it. But it made her headache

worse.



""But damn my programming!"" She spoke abruptly, aloud, nervously

fingering the locket around her neck. ""Damn it and shift circuit. He's

right! He is my husband and he is right and I'm glad. I'm glad we're

going to the camp and I'm going to help him stay.""



After all, why shouldn't a man want to do things just as much as a

robot? He had energy, circuits, feelings too. She knew he did.



For herself, she loved her Ben and Bennie. But still just that wasn't

enough occupation. She was glad they were going to the new isolation

compound for non-psychotic but unstable, hyper-active, socially

dangerous individual humans. At the camp there would be things to do.



At the camp they would be happy.



All at once the headache that had been bothering her so these past

months was gone. She felt fine and she smiled at little Bennie.

""Bennie-boy,"" she said, kissing his smooth, untroubled baby forehead.

""Daddy's coming."" Bennie laughed and started to reach for the locket

around Mommy's neck. But just then the door opened and he jumped down to

run and meet his daddy.

THE GREY WOMAN.



PORTION I.





There is a mill by the Neckar-side, to which many people resort for

coffee, according to the fashion which is almost national in Germany.

There is nothing particularly attractive in the situation of this mill;

it is on the Mannheim (the flat and unromantic) side of Heidelberg.

The river turns the mill-wheel with a plenteous gushing sound; the

out-buildings and the dwelling-house of the miller form a well-kept

dusty quadrangle. Again, further from the river, there is a garden full

of willows, and arbours, and flower-beds not well kept, but very profuse

in flowers and luxuriant creepers, knotting and looping the arbours

together. In each of these arbours is a stationary table of white

painted wood, and light moveable chairs of the same colour and material.



I went to drink coffee there with some friends in 184--. The stately old

miller came out to greet us, as some of the party were known to him of

old. He was of a grand build of a man, and his loud musical voice, with

its tone friendly and familiar, his rolling laugh of welcome, went well

with the keen bright eye, the fine cloth of his coat, and the general

look of substance about the place. Poultry of all kinds abounded in the

mill-yard, where there were ample means of livelihood for them strewed

on the ground; but not content with this, the miller took out handfuls

of corn from the sacks, and threw liberally to the cocks and hens that

ran almost under his feet in their eagerness. And all the time he was

doing this, as it were habitually, he was talking to us, and ever and

anon calling to his daughter and the serving-maids, to bid them hasten

the coffee we had ordered. He followed us to an arbour, and saw us

served to his satisfaction with the best of everything we could ask for;

and then left us to go round to the different arbours and see that each

party was properly attended to; and, as he went, this great, prosperous,

happy-looking man whistled softly one of the most plaintive airs I ever

heard.



""His family have held this mill ever since the old Palatinate days; or

rather, I should say, have possessed the ground ever since then, for two

successive mills of theirs have been burnt down by the French. If you

want to see Scherer in a passion, just talk to him of the possibility of

a French invasion.""



But at this moment, still whistling that mournful air, we saw the miller

going down the steps that led from the somewhat raised garden into the

mill-yard; and so I seemed to have lost my chance of putting him in a

passion.



We had nearly finished our coffee, and our ""kucken,"" and our cinnamon

cake, when heavy splashes fell on our thick leafy covering; quicker and

quicker they came, coming through the tender leaves as if they were

tearing them asunder; all the people in the garden were hurrying under

shelter, or seeking for their carriages standing outside. Up the steps

the miller came hastening, with a crimson umbrella, fit to cover every

one left in the garden, and followed by his daughter, and one or two

maidens, each bearing an umbrella.



""Come into the house--come in, I say. It is a summer-storm, and will

flood the place for an hour or two, till the river carries it away.

Here, here.""



And we followed him back into his own house. We went into the kitchen

first. Such an array of bright copper and tin vessels I never saw; and

all the wooden things were as thoroughly scoured. The red tile floor was

spotless when we went in, but in two minutes it was all over slop and

dirt with the tread of many feet; for the kitchen was filled, and still

the worthy miller kept bringing in more people under his great crimson

umbrella. He even called the dogs in, and made them lie down under the

tables.



His daughter said something to him in German, and he shook his head

merrily at her. Everybody laughed.



""What did she say?"" I asked.



""She told him to bring the ducks in next; but indeed if more people

come we shall be suffocated. What with the thundery weather, and the

stove, and all these steaming clothes, I really think we must ask leave

to pass on. Perhaps we might go in and see Frau Scherer.""



My friend asked the daughter of the house for permission to go into an

inner chamber and see her mother. It was granted, and we went into a

sort of saloon, overlooking the Neckar; very small, very bright, and

very close. The floor was slippery with polish; long narrow pieces

of looking-glass against the walls reflected the perpetual motion of

the river opposite; a white porcelain stove, with some old-fashioned

ornaments of brass about it; a sofa, covered with Utrecht velvet, a

table before it, and a piece of worsted-worked carpet under it; a vase

of artificial flowers; and, lastly, an alcove with a bed in it, on which

lay the paralysed wife of the good miller, knitting busily, formed the

furniture. I spoke as if this was all that was to be seen in the room;

but, sitting quietly, while my friend kept up a brisk conversation in a

language which I but half understood, my eye was caught by a picture in

a dark corner of the room, and I got up to examine it more nearly.



It was that of a young girl of extreme beauty; evidently of middle rank.

There was a sensitive refinement in her face, as if she almost shrank

from the gaze which, of necessity, the painter must have fixed upon her.

It was not over-well painted, but I felt that it must have been a good

likeness, from this strong impress of peculiar character which I have

tried to describe. From the dress, I should guess it to have been

painted in the latter half of the last century. And I afterwards heard

that I was right.



There was a little pause in the conversation.



""Will you ask Frau Scherer who this is?""



My friend repeated my question, and received a long reply in German.

Then she turned round and translated it to me.



""It is the likeness of a great-aunt of her husband's."" (My friend was

standing by me, and looking at the picture with sympathetic curiosity.)

""See! here is the name on the open page of this Bible, 'Anna Scherer,

1778.' Frau Scherer says there is a tradition in the family that this

pretty girl, with her complexion of lilies and roses, lost her colour

so entirely through fright, that she was known by the name of the

Grey Woman. She speaks as if this Anna Scherer lived in some state

of life-long terror. But she does not know details; refers me to her

husband for them. She thinks he has some papers which were written by

the original of that picture for her daughter, who died in this very

house not long after our friend there was married. We can ask Herr

Scherer for the whole story if you like.""



""Oh yes, pray do!"" said I. And, as our host came in at this moment to

ask how we were faring, and to tell us that he had sent to Heidelberg

for carriages to convey us home, seeing no chance of the heavy rain

abating, my friend, after thanking him, passed on to my request.



""Ah!"" said he, his face changing, ""the aunt Anna had a sad history.

It was all owing to one of those hellish Frenchmen; and her daughter

suffered for it--the cousin Ursula, as we all called her when I was a

child. To be sure, the good cousin Ursula was his child as well. The

sins of the fathers are visited on their children. The lady would

like to know all about it, would she? Well, there are papers--a kind

of apology the aunt Anna wrote for putting an end to her daughter's

engagement--or rather facts which she revealed, that prevented cousin

Ursula from marrying the man she loved; and so she would never have

any other good fellow, else I have heard say my father would have been

thankful to have made her his wife."" All this time he was rummaging in

the drawer of an old-fashioned bureau, and now he turned round, with a

bundle of yellow MSS. in his hand, which he gave to my friend, saying,

""Take it home, take it home, and if you care to make out our crabbed

German writing, you may keep it as long as you like, and read it at your

leisure. Only I must have it back again when you have done with it,

that's all.""



And so we became possessed of the manuscript of the following letter,

which it was our employment, during many a long evening that ensuing

winter, to translate, and in some parts to abbreviate. The letter began

with some reference to the pain which she had already inflicted upon her

daughter by some unexplained opposition to a project of marriage; but I

doubt if, without the clue with which the good miller had furnished us,

we could have made out even this much from the passionate, broken

sentences that made us fancy that some scene between the mother and

daughter--and possibly a third person--had occurred just before the

mother had begun to write.





""Thou dost not love thy child, mother! Thou dost not care if her heart

is broken!"" Ah, God! and these words of my heart-beloved Ursula ring in

my ears as if the sound of them would fill them when I lie a-dying. And

her poor tear-stained face comes between me and everything else. Child!

hearts do not break; life is very tough as well as very terrible. But I

will not decide for thee. I will tell thee all; and thou shalt bear the

burden of choice. I may be wrong; I have little wit left, and never had

much, I think; but an instinct serves me in place of judgment, and that

instinct tells me that thou and thy Henri must never be married. Yet I

may be in error. I would fain make my child happy. Lay this paper before

the good priest Schriesheim; if, after reading it, thou hast doubts

which make thee uncertain. Only I will tell thee all now, on condition

that no spoken word ever passes between us on the subject. It would kill

me to be questioned. I should have to see all present again.



My father held, as thou knowest, the mill on the Neckar, where thy

new-found uncle, Scherer, now lives. Thou rememberest the surprise with

which we were received there last vintage twelvemonth. How thy uncle

disbelieved me when I said that I was his sister Anna, whom he had long

believed to be dead, and how I had to lead thee underneath the picture,

painted of me long ago, and point out, feature by feature, the likeness

between it and thee; and how, as I spoke, I recalled first to my own

mind, and then by speech to his, the details of the time when it was

painted; the merry words that passed between us then, a happy boy and

girl; the position of the articles of furniture in the room; our father's

habits; the cherry-tree, now cut down, that shaded the window of my

bedroom, through which my brother was wont to squeeze himself, in order

to spring on to the topmost bough that would bear his weight; and thence

would pass me back his cap laden with fruit to where I sat on the

window-sill, too sick with fright for him to care much for eating the

cherries.



And at length Fritz gave way, and believed me to be his sister Anna,

even as though I were risen from the dead. And thou rememberest how

he fetched in his wife, and told her that I was not dead, but was

come back to the old home once more, changed as I was. And she would

scarce believe him, and scanned me with a cold, distrustful eye, till

at length--for I knew her of old as Babette Mller--I said that I was

well-to-do, and needed not to seek out friends for what they had to

give. And then she asked--not me, but her husband--why I had kept silent

so long, leading all--father, brother, every one that loved me in my own

dear home--to esteem me dead. And then thine uncle (thou rememberest?)

said he cared not to know more than I cared to tell; that I was his

Anna, found again, to be a blessing to him in his old age, as I had been

in his boyhood. I thanked him in my heart for his trust; for were the

need for telling all less than it seems to me now I could not speak of

my past life. But she, who was my sister-in-law still, held back her

welcome, and, for want of that, I did not go to live in Heidelberg as

I had planned beforehand, in order to be near my brother Fritz, but

contented myself with his promise to be a father to my Ursula when I

should die and leave this weary world.



That Babette Mller was, as I may say, the cause of all my life's

suffering. She was a baker's daughter in Heidelberg--a great beauty, as

people said, and, indeed, as I could see for myself. I, too--thou sawest

my picture--was reckoned a beauty, and I believe I was so. Babette Mller

looked upon me as a rival. She liked to be admired, and had no one much

to love her. I had several people to love me--thy grandfather, Fritz,

the old servant Ktchen, Karl, the head apprentice at the mill--and I

feared admiration and notice, and the being stared at as the ""Schne

Mllerin,"" whenever I went to make my purchases in Heidelberg.



Those were happy, peaceful days. I had Ktchen to help me in the

housework, and whatever we did pleased my brave old father, who was

always gentle and indulgent towards us women, though he was stern enough

with the apprentices in the mill. Karl, the oldest of these, was his

favourite; and I can see now that my father wished him to marry me, and

that Karl himself was desirous to do so. But Karl was rough-spoken, and

passionate--not with me, but with the others--and I shrank from him

in a way which, I fear, gave him pain. And then came thy uncle Fritz's

marriage; and Babette was brought to the mill to be its mistress. Not

that I cared much for giving up my post, for, in spite of my father's

great kindness, I always feared that I did not manage well for so large

a family (with the men, and a girl under Ktchen, we sat down eleven

each night to supper). But when Babette began to find fault with Ktchen,

I was unhappy at the blame that fell on faithful servants; and by-and-by

I began to see that Babette was egging on Karl to make more open love to

me, and, as she once said, to get done with it, and take me off to a

home of my own. My father was growing old, and did not perceive all my

daily discomfort. The more Karl advanced, the more I disliked him. He

was good in the main, but I had no notion of being married, and could

not bear any one who talked to me about it.



Things were in this way when I had an invitation to go to Carlsruhe to

visit a schoolfellow, of whom I had been very fond. Babette was all for

my going; I don't think I wanted to leave home, and yet I had been very

fond of Sophie Rupprecht. But I was always shy among strangers. Somehow

the affair was settled for me, but not until both Fritz and my father

had made inquiries as to the character and position of the Rupprechts.

They learned that the father had held some kind of inferior position

about the Grand-duke's court, and was now dead, leaving a widow, a noble

lady, and two daughters, the elder of whom was Sophie, my friend. Madame

Rupprecht was not rich, but more than respectable--genteel. When this

was ascertained, my father made no opposition to my going; Babette

forwarded it by all the means in her power, and even my dear Fritz had

his word to say in its favour. Only Ktchen was against it--Ktchen

and Karl. The opposition of Karl did more to send me to Carlsruhe than

anything. For I could have objected to go; but when he took upon himself

to ask what was the good of going a-gadding, visiting strangers of whom

no one knew anything, I yielded to circumstances--to the pulling of

Sophie and the pushing of Babette. I was silently vexed, I remember, at

Babette's inspection of my clothes; at the way in which she settled that

this gown was too old-fashioned, or that too common, to go with me on

my visit to a noble lady; and at the way in which she took upon herself

to spend the money my father had given me to buy what was requisite for

the occasion. And yet I blamed myself, for every one else thought her so

kind for doing all this; and she herself meant kindly, too.



At last I quitted the mill by the Neckar-side. It was a long day's

journey, and Fritz went with me to Carlsruhe. The Rupprechts lived on

the third floor of a house a little behind one of the principal streets,

in a cramped-up court, to which we gained admittance through a doorway

in the street. I remember how pinched their rooms looked after the large

space we had at the mill, and yet they had an air of grandeur about them

which was new to me, and which gave me pleasure, faded as some of it

was. Madame Rupprecht was too formal a lady for me; I was never at my

ease with her; but Sophie was all that I had recollected her at school:

kind, affectionate, and only rather too ready with her expressions

of admiration and regard. The little sister kept out of our way; and

that was all we needed, in the first enthusiastic renewal of our early

friendship. The one great object of Madame Rupprecht's life was to

retain her position in society; and as her means were much diminished

since her husband's death, there was not much comfort, though there was

a great deal of show, in their way of living; just the opposite of what

it was at my father's house. I believe that my coming was not too much

desired by Madame Rupprecht, as I brought with me another mouth to be

fed; but Sophie had spent a year or more in entreating for permission to

invite me, and her mother, having once consented, was too well bred not

to give me a stately welcome.



The life in Carlsruhe was very different from what it was at home. The

hours were later, the coffee was weaker in the morning, the pottage was

weaker, the boiled beef less relieved by other diet, the dresses finer,

the evening engagements constant. I did not find these visits pleasant.

We might not knit, which would have relieved the tedium a little; but we

sat in a circle, talking together, only interrupted occasionally by a

gentleman, who, breaking out of the knot of men who stood near the door,

talking eagerly together, stole across the room on tiptoe, his hat under

his arm, and, bringing his feet together in the position we called the

first at the dancing-school, made a low bow to the lady he was going to

address. The first time I saw these manners I could not help smiling;

but Madame Rupprecht saw me, and spoke to me next morning rather severely,

telling me that, of course, in my country breeding I could have seen

nothing of court manners, or French fashions, but that that was no

reason for my laughing at them. Of course I tried never to smile again

in company. This visit to Carlsruhe took place in '89, just when every

one was full of the events taking place at Paris; and yet at Carlsruhe

French fashions were more talked of than French politics. Madame

Rupprecht, especially, thought a great deal of all French people. And

this again was quite different to us at home. Fritz could hardly bear

the name of a Frenchman; and it had nearly been an obstacle to my visit

to Sophie that her mother preferred being called Madame to her proper

title of Frau.



[Illustration p. 17: Monsieur de la Tourelle.]



One night I was sitting next to Sophie, and longing for the time when we

might have supper and go home, so as to be able to speak together, a

thing forbidden by Madame Rupprecht's rules of etiquette, which strictly

prohibited any but the most necessary conversation passing between

members of the same family when in society. I was sitting, I say,

scarcely keeping back my inclination to yawn, when two gentlemen came

in, one of whom was evidently a stranger to the whole party, from the

formal manner in which the host led him up, and presented him to the

hostess. I thought I had never seen any one so handsome or so elegant.

His hair was powdered, of course, but one could see from his complexion

that it was fair in its natural state. His features were as delicate as

a girl's, and set off by two little ""mouches,"" as we called patches in

those days, one at the left corner of his mouth, the other prolonging,

as it were, the right eye. His dress was blue and silver. I was so lost

in admiration of this beautiful young man, that I was as much surprised

as if the angel Gabriel had spoken to me, when the lady of the house

brought him forward to present him to me. She called him Monsieur de la

Tourelle, and he began to speak to me in French; but though I understood

him perfectly, I dared not trust myself to reply to him in that language.

Then he tried German, speaking it with a kind of soft lisp that I

thought charming. But, before the end of the evening, I became a little

tired of the affected softness and effeminacy of his manners, and the

exaggerated compliments he paid me, which had the effect of making all

the company turn round and look at me. Madame Rupprecht was, however,

pleased with the precise thing that displeased me. She liked either

Sophie or me to create a sensation; of course she would have preferred

that it should have been her daughter, but her daughter's friend was

next best. As we went away, I heard Madame Rupprecht and Monsieur de la

Tourelle reciprocating civil speeches with might and main, from which I

found out that the French gentleman was coming to call on us the next

day. I do not know whether I was more glad or frightened, for I had been

kept upon stilts of good manners all the evening. But still I was

flattered when Madame Rupprecht spoke as if she had invited him, because

he had shown pleasure in my society, and even more gratified by Sophie's

ungrudging delight at the evident interest I had excited in so fine and

agreeable a gentleman. Yet, with all this, they had hard work to keep me

from running out of the salon the next day, when we heard his voice

inquiring at the gate on the stairs for Madame Rupprecht. They had made

me put on my Sunday gown, and they themselves were dressed as for a

reception.



When he was gone away, Madame Rupprecht congratulated me on the conquest

I had made; for, indeed, he had scarcely spoken to any one else, beyond

what mere civility required, and had almost invited himself to come in

the evening to bring some new song, which was all the fashion in Paris,

he said. Madame Rupprecht had been out all morning, as she told me, to

glean information about Monsieur de la Tourelle. He was a propritaire,

had a small chteau on the Vosges mountains; he owned land there, but

had a large income from some sources quite independent of this property.

Altogether, he was a good match, as she emphatically observed. She

never seemed to think that I could refuse him after this account of his

wealth, nor do I believe she would have allowed Sophie a choice, even

had he been as old and ugly as he was young and handsome. I do not quite

know--so many events have come to pass since then, and blurred the

clearness of my recollections--if I loved him or not. He was very much

devoted to me; he almost frightened me by the excess of his demonstrations

of love. And he was very charming to everybody around me, who all spoke

of him as the most fascinating of men, and of me as the most fortunate

of girls. And yet I never felt quite at my ease with him. I was always

relieved when his visits were over, although I missed his presence when

he did not come. He prolonged his visit to the friend with whom he was

staying at Carlsruhe, on purpose to woo me. He loaded me with presents,

which I was unwilling to take, only Madame Rupprecht seemed to consider

me an affected prude if I refused them. Many of these presents consisted

of articles of valuable old jewellery, evidently belonging to his family;

by accepting these I doubled the ties which were formed around me by

circumstances even more than by my own consent. In those days we did not

write letters to absent friends as frequently as is done now, and I had

been unwilling to name him in the few letters that I wrote home. At

length, however, I learned from Madame Rupprecht that she had written to

my father to announce the splendid conquest I had made, and to request

his presence at my betrothal. I started with astonishment. I had not

realized that affairs had gone so far as this. But when she asked me, in

a stern, offended manner, what I had meant by my conduct if I did not

intend to marry Monsieur de la Tourelle--I had received his visits, his

presents, all his various advances without showing any unwillingness or

repugnance--(and it was all true; I had shown no repugnance, though I

did not wish to be married to him,--at least, not so soon)--what could I

do but hang my head, and silently consent to the rapid enunciation of

the only course which now remained for me if I would not be esteemed a

heartless coquette all the rest of my days?



There was some difficulty, which I afterwards learnt that my

sister-in-law had obviated, about my betrothal taking place from home.

My father, and Fritz especially, were for having me return to the mill,

and there be betrothed, and from thence be married. But the Rupprechts

and Monsieur de la Tourelle were equally urgent on the other side; and

Babette was unwilling to have the trouble of the commotion at the mill;

and also, I think, a little disliked the idea of the contrast of my

grander marriage with her own.



So my father and Fritz came over to the betrothal. They were to stay

at an inn in Carlsruhe for a fortnight, at the end of which time the

marriage was to take place. Monsieur de la Tourelle told me he had

business at home, which would oblige him to be absent during the

interval between the two events; and I was very glad of it, for I

did not think that he valued my father and my brother as I could have

wished him to do. He was very polite to them; put on all the soft, grand

manner, which he had rather dropped with me; and complimented us all

round, beginning with my father and Madame Rupprecht, and ending with

little Alwina. But he a little scoffed at the old-fashioned church

ceremonies which my father insisted on; and I fancy Fritz must have

taken some of his compliments as satire, for I saw certain signs of

manner by which I knew that my future husband, for all his civil words,

had irritated and annoyed my brother. But all the money arrangements

were liberal in the extreme, and more than satisfied, almost surprised,

my father. Even Fritz lifted up his eyebrows and whistled. I alone did

not care about anything. I was bewitched,--in a dream,--a kind of

despair. I had got into a net through my own timidity and weakness, and

I did not see how to get out of it. I clung to my own home-people that

fortnight as I had never done before. Their voices, their ways were all

so pleasant and familiar to me, after the constraint in which I had

been living. I might speak and do as I liked without being corrected

by Madame Rupprecht, or reproved in a delicate, complimentary way by

Monsieur de la Tourelle. One day I said to my father that I did not want

to be married, that I would rather go back to the dear old mill; but he

seemed to feel this speech of mine as a dereliction of duty as great as

if I had committed perjury; as if, after the ceremony of betrothal, no

one had any right over me but my future husband. And yet he asked me

some solemn questions; but my answers were not such as to do me any

good.



""Dost thou know any fault or crime in this man that should prevent God's

blessing from resting on thy marriage with him? Dost thou feel aversion

or repugnance to him in any way?""



And to all this what could I say? I could only stammer out that I

did not think I loved him enough; and my poor old father saw in this

reluctance only the fancy of a silly girl who did not know her own mind,

but who had now gone too far to recede.



So we were married, in the Court chapel, a privilege which Madame

Rupprecht had used no end of efforts to obtain for us, and which she

must have thought was to secure us all possible happiness, both at the

time and in recollection afterwards.



We were married; and after two days spent in festivity at Carlsruhe,

among all our new fashionable friends there, I bade good-by for ever

to my dear old father. I had begged my husband to take me by way of

Heidelberg to his old castle in the Vosges; but I found an amount of

determination, under that effeminate appearance and manner, for which I

was not prepared, and he refused my first request so decidedly that I

dared not urge it. ""Henceforth, Anna,"" said he, ""you will move in a

different sphere of life; and though it is possible that you may have

the power of showing favour to your relations from time to time, yet

much or familiar intercourse will be undesirable, and is what I cannot

allow."" I felt almost afraid, after this formal speech, of asking my

father and Fritz to come and see me; but, when the agony of bidding

them farewell overcame all my prudence, I did beg them to pay me a visit

ere long. But they shook their heads, and spoke of business at home,

of different kinds of life, of my being a Frenchwoman now. Only my

father broke out at last with a blessing, and said, ""If my child is

unhappy--which God forbid--let her remember that her father's house is

ever open to her."" I was on the point of crying out, ""Oh! take me back

then now, my father! oh, my father!"" when I felt, rather than saw, my

husband present near me. He looked on with a slightly contemptuous air;

and, taking my hand in his, he led me weeping away, saying that short

farewells were always the best when they were inevitable.



It took us two days to reach his chteau in the Vosges, for the roads

were bad and the way difficult to ascertain. Nothing could be more

devoted than he was all the time of the journey. It seemed as if he

were trying in every way to make up for the separation which every hour

made me feel the more complete between my present and my former life.

I seemed as if I were only now wakening up to a full sense of what

marriage was, and I dare say I was not a cheerful companion on the

tedious journey. At length, jealousy of my regret for my father and

brother got the better of M. de la Tourelle, and he became so much

displeased with me that I thought my heart would break with the sense of

desolation. So it was in no cheerful frame of mind that we approached

Les Rochers, and I thought that perhaps it was because I was so unhappy

that the place looked so dreary. On one side, the chteau looked like a

raw new building, hastily run up for some immediate purpose, without any

growth of trees or underwood near it, only the remains of the stone used

for building, not yet cleared away from the immediate neighbourhood,

although weeds and lichens had been suffered to grow near and over the

heaps of rubbish; on the other, were the great rocks from which the

place took its name, and rising close against them, as if almost a

natural formation, was the old castle, whose building dated many

centuries back.



It was not large nor grand, but it was strong and picturesque, and I used

to wish that we lived in it rather than in the smart, half-furnished

apartment in the new edifice, which had been hastily got ready for my

reception. Incongruous as the two parts were, they were joined into a

whole by means of intricate passages and unexpected doors, the exact

positions of which I never fully understood. M. de la Tourelle led me to

a suite of rooms set apart for me, and formally installed me in them, as

in a domain of which I was sovereign. He apologised for the hasty

preparation which was all he had been able to make for me, but promised,

before I asked, or even thought of complaining, that they should be made

as luxurious as heart could wish before many weeks had elapsed. But

when, in the gloom of an autumnal evening, I caught my own face and

figure reflected in all the mirrors, which showed only a mysterious

background in the dim light of the many candles which failed to

illuminate the great proportions of the half-furnished salon, I clung to

M. de la Tourelle, and begged to be taken to the rooms he had occupied

before his marriage, he seemed angry with me, although he affected to

laugh, and so decidedly put aside the notion of my having any other

rooms but these, that I trembled in silence at the fantastic figures and

shapes which my imagination called up as peopling the background of

those gloomy mirrors. There was my boudoir, a little less dreary--my

bedroom, with its grand and tarnished furniture, which I commonly made

into my sitting-room, locking up the various doors which led into the

boudoir, the salon, the passages--all but one, through which M. de la

Tourelle always entered from his own apartments in the older part of

the castle. But this preference of mine for occupying my bedroom annoyed

M. de la Tourelle, I am sure, though he did not care to express his

displeasure. He would always allure me back into the salon, which I

disliked more and more from its complete separation from the rest of the

building by the long passage into which all the doors of my apartment

opened. This passage was closed by heavy doors and portires, through

which I could not hear a sound from the other parts of the house, and,

of course, the servants could not hear any movement or cry of mine

unless expressly summoned. To a girl brought up as I had been in a

household where every individual lived all day in the sight of every

other member of the family, never wanted either cheerful words or the

sense of silent companionship, this grand isolation of mine was very

formidable; and the more so, because M. de la Tourelle, as landed

proprietor, sportsman, and what not, was generally out of doors the

greater part of every day, and sometimes for two or three days at a

time. I had no pride to keep me from associating with the domestics; it

would have been natural to me in many ways to have sought them out for

a word of sympathy in those dreary days when I was left so entirely to

myself, had they been like our kindly German servants. But I disliked

them, one and all; I could not tell why. Some were civil, but there was

a familiarity in their civility which repelled me; others were rude, and

treated me more as if I were an intruder than their master's chosen

wife; and yet of the two sets I liked these last the best.



The principal male servant belonged to this latter class. I was very

much afraid of him, he had such an air of suspicious surliness about him

in all he did for me; and yet M. de la Tourelle spoke of him as most

valuable and faithful. Indeed, it sometimes struck me that Lefebvre

ruled his master in some things; and this I could not make out. For,

while M. de la Tourelle behaved towards me as if I were some precious

toy or idol, to be cherished, and fostered, and petted, and indulged, I

soon found out how little I, or, apparently, any one else, could bend

the terrible will of the man who had on first acquaintance appeared

to me too effeminate and languid to exert his will in the slightest

particular. I had learnt to know his face better now; and to see that

some vehement depth of feeling, the cause of which I could not fathom,

made his grey eye glitter with pale light, and his lips contract, and

his delicate cheek whiten on certain occasions. But all had been so open

and above board at home, that I had no experience to help me to unravel

any mysteries among those who lived under the same roof. I understood

that I had made what Madame Rupprecht and her set would have called a

great marriage, because I lived in a chteau with many servants, bound

ostensibly to obey me as a mistress. I understood that M. de la Tourelle

was fond enough of me in his way--proud of my beauty, I dare say (for

he often enough spoke about it to me)--but he was also jealous, and

suspicious, and uninfluenced by my wishes, unless they tallied with his

own. I felt at this time as if I could have been fond of him too, if he

would have let me; but I was timid from my childhood, and before long my

dread of his displeasure (coming down like thunder into the midst of his

love, for such slight causes as a hesitation in reply, a wrong word, or

a sigh for my father), conquered my humorous inclination to love one who

was so handsome, so accomplished, so indulgent and devoted. But if I

could not please him when indeed I loved him, you may imagine how often

I did wrong when I was so much afraid of him as to quietly avoid his

company for fear of his outbursts of passion. One thing I remember

noticing, that the more M. de la Tourelle was displeased with me, the

more Lefebvre seemed to chuckle; and when I was restored to favour,

sometimes on as sudden an impulse as that which occasioned my disgrace,

Lefebvre would look askance at me with his cold, malicious eyes, and

once or twice at such times he spoke most disrespectfully to M. de la

Tourelle.



I have almost forgotten to say that, in the early days of my life at

Les Rochers, M. de la Tourelle, in contemptuous indulgent pity at my

weakness in disliking the dreary grandeur of the salon, wrote up to

the milliner in Paris from whom my corbeille de mariage had come, to

desire her to look out for me a maid of middle age, experienced in the

toilette, and with so much refinement that she might on occasion serve

as companion to me.





PORTION II.



A Norman woman, Amante by name, was sent to Les Rochers by the Paris

milliner, to become my maid. She was tall and handsome, though upwards

of forty, and somewhat gaunt. But, on first seeing her, I liked her;

she was neither rude nor familiar in her manners, and had a pleasant

look of straightforwardness about her that I had missed in all the

inhabitants of the chteau, and had foolishly set down in my own mind as

a national want. Amante was directed by M. de la Tourelle to sit in my

boudoir, and to be always within call. He also gave her many instructions

as to her duties in matters which, perhaps, strictly belonged to my

department of management. But I was young and inexperienced, and thankful

to be spared any responsibility.



I daresay it was true what M. de la Tourelle said--before many weeks had

elapsed--that, for a great lady, a lady of a castle, I became sadly too

familiar with my Norman waiting-maid. But you know that by birth we were

not very far apart in rank: Amante was the daughter of a Norman farmer,

I of a German miller; and besides that, my life was so lonely! It almost

seemed as if I could not please my husband. He had written for some one

capable of being my companion at times, and now he was jealous of my

free regard for her--angry because I could sometimes laugh at her original

tunes and amusing proverbs, while when with him I was too much frightened

to smile.



From time to time families from a distance of some leagues drove through

the bad roads in their heavy carriages to pay us a visit, and there was

an occasional talk of our going to Paris when public affairs should be

a little more settled. These little events and plans were the only

variations in my life for the first twelve months, if I except the

alternations in M. de la Tourelle's temper, his unreasonable anger, and

his passionate fondness.



Perhaps one of the reasons that made me take pleasure and comfort in

Amante's society was, that whereas I was afraid of everybody (I do not

think I was half as much afraid of things as of persons), Amante feared

no one. She would quietly beard Lefebvre, and he respected her all the

more for it; she had a knack of putting questions to M. de la Tourelle,

which respectfully informed him that she had detected the weak point,

but forebore to press him too closely upon it out of deference to his

position as her master. And with all her shrewdness to others, she

had quite tender ways with me; all the more so at this time because

she knew, what I had not yet ventured to tell M. de la Tourelle, that

by-and-by I might become a mother--that wonderful object of mysterious

interest to single women, who no longer hope to enjoy such blessedness

themselves.



It was once more autumn; late in October. But I was reconciled to my

habitation; the walls of the new part of the building no longer looked

bare and desolate; the _dbris_ had been so far cleared away by M. de la

Tourelle's desire as to make me a little flower-garden, in which I tried

to cultivate those plants that I remembered as growing at home. Amante

and I had moved the furniture in the rooms, and adjusted it to our

liking; my husband had ordered many an article from time to time that he

thought would give me pleasure, and I was becoming tame to my apparent

imprisonment in a certain part of the great building, the whole of which

I had never yet explored. It was October, as I say, once more. The days

were lovely, though short in duration, and M. de la Tourelle had

occasion, so he said, to go to that distant estate the superintendence

of which so frequently took him away from home. He took Lefebvre with

him, and possibly some more of the lacqueys; he often did. And my

spirits rose a little at the thought of his absence; and then the new

sensation that he was the father of my unborn babe came over me, and I

tried to invest him with this fresh character. I tried to believe that

it was his passionate love for me that made him so jealous and

tyrannical, imposing, as he did, restrictions on my very intercourse

with my dear father, from whom I was so entirely separated, as far as

personal intercourse was concerned.



I had, it is true, let myself go into a sorrowful review of all the

troubles which lay hidden beneath the seeming luxury of my life. I knew

that no one cared for me except my husband and Amante; for it was clear

enough to see that I, as his wife, and also as a _parvenue_, was not

popular among the few neighbours who surrounded us; and as for the

servants, the women were all hard and impudent-looking, treating me

with a semblance of respect that had more of mockery than reality in

it; while the men had a lurking kind of fierceness about them, sometimes

displayed even to M. de la Tourelle, who on his part, it must be confessed,

was often severe even to cruelty in his management of them. My husband

loved me, I said to myself, but I said it almost in the form of a

question. His love was shown fitfully, and more in ways calculated to

please himself than to please me. I felt that for no wish of mine would

he deviate one tittle from any predetermined course of action. I had

learnt the inflexibility of those thin, delicate lips; I knew how anger

would turn his fair complexion to deadly white, and bring the cruel

light into his pale blue eyes. The love I bore to any one seemed to be

a reason for his hating them, and so I went on pitying myself one long

dreary afternoon during that absence of his of which I have spoken, only

sometimes remembering to check myself in my murmurings by thinking of

the new unseen link between us, and then crying afresh to think how

wicked I was. Oh, how well I remember that long October evening! Amante

came in from time to time, talking away to cheer me--talking about dress

and Paris, and I hardly know what, but from time to time looking at me

keenly with her friendly dark eyes, and with serious interest, too,

though all her words were about frivolity. At length she heaped the fire

with wood, drew the heavy silken curtains close; for I had been anxious

hitherto to keep them open, so that I might see the pale moon mounting

the skies, as I used to see her--the same moon--rise from behind the

Kaiser Stuhl at Heidelberg; but the sight made me cry, so Amante shut it

out. She dictated to me as a nurse does to a child.



""Now, madame must have the little kitten to keep her company,"" she said,

""while I go and ask Marthon for a cup of coffee."" I remember that speech,

and the way it roused me, for I did not like Amante to think I wanted

amusing by a kitten. It might be my petulance, but this speech--such as

she might have made to a child--annoyed me, and I said that I had reason

for my lowness of spirits--meaning that they were not of so imaginary

a nature that I could be diverted from them by the gambols of a kitten.

So, though I did not choose to tell her all, I told her a part; and as

I spoke, I began to suspect that the good creature knew much of what I

withheld, and that the little speech about the kitten was more thoughtfully

kind than it had seemed at first. I said that it was so long since I had

heard from my father; that he was an old man, and so many things might

happen--I might never see him again--and I so seldom heard from him or

my brother. It was a more complete and total separation than I had ever

anticipated when I married, and something of my home and of my life

previous to my marriage I told the good Amante; for I had not been

brought up as a great lady, and the sympathy of any human being was

precious to me.



Amante listened with interest, and in return told me some of the events

and sorrows of her own life. Then, remembering her purpose, she set out

in search of the coffee, which ought to have been brought to me an hour

before; but, in my husband's absence, my wishes were but seldom attended

to, and I never dared to give orders.



Presently she returned, bringing the coffee and a great large cake.



""See!"" said she, setting it down. ""Look at my plunder. Madame must eat.

Those who eat always laugh. And, besides, I have a little news that will

please madame."" Then she told me that, lying on a table in the great

kitchen, was a bundle of letters, come by the courier from Strasburg

that very afternoon: then, fresh from her conversation with me, she had

hastily untied the string that bound them, but had only just traced out

one that she thought was from Germany, when a servant-man came in, and,

with the start he gave her, she dropped the letters, which he picked

up, swearing at her for having untied and disarranged them. She told

him that she believed there was a letter there for her mistress; but he

only swore the more, saying, that if there was it was no business of

hers, or of his either, for that he had the strictest orders always to

take all letters that arrived during his master's absence into the

private sitting-room of the latter--a room into which I had never

entered, although it opened out of my husband's dressing-room.



I asked Amante if she had not conquered and brought me this letter. No,

indeed, she replied, it was almost as much as her life was worth to live

among such a set of servants: it was only a month ago that Jacques had

stabbed Valentin for some jesting talk. Had I never missed Valentin--that

handsome young lad who carried up the wood into my salon? Poor fellow!

he lies dead and cold now, and they said in the village he had put an

end to himself, but those of the household knew better. Oh! I need not

be afraid; Jacques was gone, no one knew where; but with such people it

was not safe to upbraid or insist. Monsieur would be at home the next

day, and it would not be long to wait.



But I felt as if I could not exist till the next day, without the

letter. It might be to say that my father was ill, dying--he might cry

for his daughter from his death-bed! In short, there was no end to the

thoughts and fancies that haunted me. It was of no use for Amante to say

that, after all, she might be mistaken--that she did not read writing

well--that she had but a glimpse of the address; I let my coffee cool,

my food all became distasteful, and I wrung my hands with impatience to

get at the letter, and have some news of my dear ones at home. All the

time, Amante kept her imperturbable good temper, first reasoning, then

scolding. At last she said, as if wearied out, that if I would consent

to make a good supper, she would see what could be done as to our going

to monsieur's room in search of the letter, after the servants were all

gone to bed. We agreed to go together when all was still, and look over

the letters; there could be no harm in that; and yet, somehow, we were

such cowards we dared not do it openly and in the face of the household.



Presently my supper came up--partridges, bread, fruits, and cream. How

well I remember that supper! We put the untouched cake away in a sort of

buffet, and poured the cold coffee out of the window, in order that the

servants might not take offence at the apparent fancifulness of sending

down for food I could not eat. I was so anxious for all to be in bed,

that I told the footman who served that he need not wait to take away

the plates and dishes, but might go to bed. Long after I thought the

house was quiet, Amante, in her caution, made me wait. It was past

eleven before we set out, with cat-like steps and veiled light, along

the passages, to go to my husband's room and steal my own letter, if it

was indeed there; a fact about which Amante had become very uncertain in

the progress of our discussion.



To make you understand my story, I must now try to explain to you the

plan of the chteau. It had been at one time a fortified place of some

strength, perched on the summit of a rock, which projected from the side

of the mountain. But additions had been made to the old building (which

must have borne a strong resemblance to the castles overhanging the

Rhine), and these new buildings were placed so as to command a magnificent

view, being on the steepest side of the rock, from which the mountain

fell away, as it were, leaving the great plain of France in full survey.

The ground-plan was something of the shape of three sides of an oblong;

my apartments in the modern edifice occupied the narrow end, and had

this grand prospect. The front of the castle was old, and ran parallel

to the road far below. In this were contained the offices and public

rooms of various descriptions, into which I never penetrated. The back

wing (considering the new building, in which my apartments were, as the

centre) consisted of many rooms, of a dark and gloomy character, as the

mountain-side shut out much of the sun, and heavy pine woods came down

within a few yards of the windows. Yet on this side--on a projecting

plateau of the rock--my husband had formed the flower-garden of which I

have spoken; for he was a great cultivator of flowers in his leisure

moments.



Now my bedroom was the corner room of the new buildings on the part

next to the mountain. Hence I could have let myself down into the

flower-garden by my hands on the window-sill on one side, without danger

of hurting myself; while the windows at right angles with these looked

sheer down a descent of a hundred feet at least. Going still farther

along this wing, you came to the old building; in fact, these two

fragments of the ancient castle had formerly been attached by some such

connecting apartments as my husband had rebuilt. These rooms belonged to

M. de la Tourelle. His bedroom opened into mine, his dressing-room lay

beyond; and that was pretty nearly all I knew, for the servants, as

well as he himself, had a knack of turning me back, under some pretence,

if ever they found me walking about alone, as I was inclined to do, when

first I came, from a sort of curiosity to see the whole of the place of

which I found myself mistress. M. de la Tourelle never encouraged me to

go out alone, either in a carriage or for a walk, saying always that the

roads were unsafe in those disturbed times; indeed, I have sometimes

fancied since that the flower-garden, to which the only access from the

castle was through his rooms, was designed in order to give me exercise

and employment under his own eye.



But to return to that night. I knew, as I have said, that M. de la

Tourelle's private room opened out of his dressing-room, and this out

of his bedroom, which again opened into mine, the corner-room. But there

were other doors into all these rooms, and these doors led into a long

gallery, lighted by windows, looking into the inner court. I do not

remember our consulting much about it; we went through my room into

my husband's apartment through the dressing-room, but the door of

communication into his study was locked, so there was nothing for it

but to turn back and go by the gallery to the other door. I recollect

noticing one or two things in these rooms, then seen by me for the first

time. I remember the sweet perfume that hung in the air, the scent

bottles of silver that decked his toilet-table, and the whole apparatus

for bathing and dressing, more luxurious even than those which he had

provided for me. But the room itself was less splendid in its proportions

than mine. In truth, the new buildings ended at the entrance to my

husband's dressing-room. There were deep window recesses in walls eight

or nine feet thick, and even the partitions between the chambers were

three feet deep; but over all these doors or windows there fell thick,

heavy draperies, so that I should think no one could have heard in one

room what passed in another. We went back into my room, and out into the

gallery. We had to shade our candle, from a fear that possessed us, I

don't know why, lest some of the servants in the opposite wing might

trace our progress towards the part of the castle unused by any one

except my husband. Somehow, I had always the feeling that all the

domestics, except Amante, were spies upon me, and that I was trammelled

in a web of observation and unspoken limitation extending over all my

actions.



There was a light in the upper room; we paused, and Amante would have

again retreated, but I was chafing under the delays. What was the harm

of my seeking my father's unopened letter to me in my husband's study?

I, generally the coward, now blamed Amante for her unusual timidity.

But the truth was, she had far more reason for suspicion as to the

proceedings of that terrible household than I had ever known of. I urged

her on, I pressed on myself; we came to the door, locked, but with the

key in it; we turned it, we entered; the letters lay on the table, their

white oblongs catching the light in an instant, and revealing themselves

to my eager eyes, hungering after the words of love from my peaceful,

distant home. But just as I pressed forward to examine the letters, the

candle which Amante held, caught in some draught, went out, and we were

in darkness. Amante proposed that we should carry the letters back to

my salon, collecting them as well as we could in the dark, and returning

all but the expected one for me; but I begged her to return to my room,

where I kept tinder and flint, and to strike a fresh light; and so she

went, and I remained alone in the room, of which I could only just

distinguish the size, and the principal articles of furniture: a large

table, with a deep, overhanging cloth, in the middle, escritoires and

other heavy articles against the walls; all this I could see as I stood

there, my hand on the table close by the letters, my face towards the

window, which, both from the darkness of the wood growing high up the

mountain-side and the faint light of the declining moon, seemed only

like an oblong of paler purpler black than the shadowy room. How much I

remembered from my one instantaneous glance before the candle went out,

how much I saw as my eyes became accustomed to the darkness, I do not

know, but even now, in my dreams, comes up that room of horror, distinct

in its profound shadow. Amante could hardly have been gone a minute

before I felt an additional gloom before the window, and heard soft

movements outside--soft, but resolute, and continued until the end was

accomplished, and the window raised.



In mortal terror of people forcing an entrance at such an hour, and in

such a manner as to leave no doubt of their purpose, I would have turned

to fly when first I heard the noise, only that I feared by any quick

motion to catch their attention, as I also ran the danger of doing by

opening the door, which was all but closed, and to whose handlings

I was unaccustomed. Again, quick as lightning, I bethought me of the

hiding-place between the locked door to my husband's dressing-room and

the portire which covered it; but I gave that up, I felt as if I could

not reach it without screaming or fainting. So I sank down softly,

and crept under the table, hidden, as I hoped, by the great, deep

table-cover, with its heavy fringe. I had not recovered my swooning

senses fully, and was trying to reassure myself as to my being in a

place of comparative safety, for, above all things, I dreaded the

betrayal of fainting, and struggled hard for such courage as I might

attain by deadening myself to the danger I was in by inflicting intense

pain on myself. You have often asked me the reason of that mark on my

hand; it was where, in my agony, I bit out a piece of flesh with my

relentless teeth, thankful for the pain, which helped to numb my terror.

I say, I was but just concealed when I heard the window lifted, and one

after another stepped over the sill, and stood by me so close that I

could have touched their feet. Then they laughed and whispered; my brain

swam so that I could not tell the meaning of their words, but I heard my

husband's laughter among the rest--low, hissing, scornful--as he kicked

something heavy that they had dragged in over the floor, and which lay

near me; so near, that my husband's kick, in touching it, touched me

too. I don't know why--I can't tell how--but some feeling, and not

curiosity, prompted me to put out my hand, ever so softly, ever so

little, and feel in the darkness for what lay spurned beside me. I

stole my groping palm upon the clenched and chilly hand of a corpse!



Strange to say, this roused me to instant vividness of thought. Till

this moment I had almost forgotten Amante; now I planned with feverish

rapidity how I could give her a warning not to return; or rather, I

should say, I tried to plan, for all my projects were utterly futile, as

I might have seen from the first. I could only hope she would hear the

voices of those who were now busy in trying to kindle a light, swearing

awful oaths at the mislaid articles which would have enabled them to

strike fire. I heard her step outside coming nearer and nearer; I saw

from my hiding-place the line of light beneath the door more and more

distinctly; close to it her footstep paused; the men inside--at the time

I thought they had been only two, but I found out afterwards there were

three--paused in their endeavours, and were quite still, as breathless

as myself, I suppose. Then she slowly pushed the door open with gentle

motion, to save her flickering candle from being again extinguished. For

a moment all was still. Then I heard my husband say, as he advanced

towards her (he wore riding-boots, the shape of which I knew well, as I

could see them in the light),--



""Amante, may I ask what brings you here into my private room?""



He stood between her and the dead body of a man, from which ghastly heap

I shrank away as it almost touched me, so close were we all together. I

could not tell whether she saw it or not; I could give her no warning,

nor make any dumb utterance of signs to bid her what to say--if, indeed,

I knew myself what would be best for her to say.



Her voice was quite changed when she spoke; quite hoarse, and very low;

yet it was steady enough as she said, what was the truth, that she had

come to look for a letter which she believed had arrived for me from

Germany. Good, brave Amante! Not a word about me. M. de la Tourelle

answered with a grim blasphemy and a fearful threat. He would have no

one prying into his premises; madame should have her letters, if there

were any, when he chose to give them to her, if, indeed, he thought

it well to give them to her at all. As for Amante, this was her first

warning, but it was also her last; and, taking the candle out of her

hand, he turned her out of the room, his companions discreetly making a

screen, so as to throw the corpse into deep shadow. I heard the key turn

in the door after her--if I had ever had any thought of escape it was

gone now. I only hoped that whatever was to befal me might soon be over,

for the tension of nerve was growing more than I could bear. The instant

she could be supposed to be out of hearing, two voices began speaking

in the most angry terms to my husband, upbraiding him for not having

detained her, gagged her--nay, one was for killing her, saying he had

seen her eye fall on the face of the dead man, whom he now kicked in his

passion. Though the form of their speech was as if they were speaking

to equals, yet in their tone there was something of fear. I am sure my

husband was their superior, or captain, or somewhat. He replied to them

almost as if he were scoffing at them, saying it was such an expenditure

of labour having to do with fools; that, ten to one, the woman was

only telling the simple truth, and that she was frightened enough by

discovering her master in his room to be thankful to escape and return

to her mistress, to whom he could easily explain on the morrow how he

happened to return in the dead of night. But his companions fell to

cursing me, and saying that since M. de la Tourelle had been married he

was fit for nothing but to dress himself fine and scent himself with

perfume; that, as for me, they could have got him twenty girls prettier,

and with far more spirit in them. He quietly answered that I suited him,

and that was enough. All this time they were doing something--I could

not see what--to the corpse; sometimes they were too busy rifling the

dead body, I believe, to talk; again they let it fall with a heavy,

resistless thud, and took to quarrelling. They taunted my husband with

angry vehemence, enraged at his scoffing and scornful replies, his

mocking laughter. Yes, holding up his poor dead victim, the better to

strip him of whatever he wore that was valuable, I heard my husband

laugh just as he had done when exchanging repartees in the little salon

of the Rupprechts at Carlsruhe. I hated and dreaded him from that moment.

At length, as if to make an end of the subject, he said, with cool

determination in his voice,--



""Now, my good friends, what is the use of all this talking, when you

know in your hearts that, if I suspected my wife of knowing more than I

chose of my affairs, she would not outlive the day? Remember Victorine.

Because she merely joked about my affairs in an imprudent manner, and

rejected my advice to keep a prudent tongue--to see what she liked, but

ask nothing and say nothing--she has gone a long journey--longer than to

Paris.""



""But this one is different to her; we knew all that Madame Victorine

knew, she was such a chatterbox; but this one may find out a vast deal,

and never breathe a word about it, she is so sly. Some fine day we may

have the country raised, and the gendarmes down upon us from Strasburg,

and all owing to your pretty doll, with her cunning ways of coming over

you.""



I think this roused M. de la Tourelle a little from his contemptuous

indifference, for he ground an oath through his teeth, and said, ""Feel!

this dagger is sharp, Henri. If my wife breathes a word, and I am such a

fool as not to have stopped her mouth effectually before she can bring

down gendarmes upon us, just let that good steel find its way to my

heart. Let her guess but one tittle, let her have but one slight suspicion

that I am not a 'grand propritaire,' much less imagine that I am a

chief of Chauffeurs, and she follows Victorine on the long journey

beyond Paris that very day.""



""She'll outwit you yet; or I never judged women well. Those still silent

ones are the devil. She'll be off during some of your absences, having

picked out some secret that will break us all on the wheel.""



""Bah!"" said his voice; and then in a minute he added, ""Let her go if she

will. But, where she goes, I will follow; so don't cry before you're

hurt.""



By this time, they had nearly stripped the body; and the conversation

turned on what they should do with it. I learnt that the dead man was

the Sieur de Poissy, a neighbouring gentleman, whom I had often heard of

as hunting with my husband. I had never seen him, but they spoke as if

he had come upon them while they were robbing some Cologne merchant,

torturing him after the cruel practice of the Chauffeurs, by roasting

the feet of their victims in order to compel them to reveal any hidden

circumstances connected with their wealth, of which the Chauffeurs

afterwards made use; and this Sieur de Poissy coming down upon them,

and recognising M. de la Tourelle, they had killed him, and brought him

thither after nightfall. I heard him whom I called my husband, laugh his

little light laugh as he spoke of the way in which the dead body had

been strapped before one of the riders, in such a way that it appeared

to any passer-by as if, in truth, the murderer were tenderly supporting

some sick person. He repeated some mocking reply of double meaning, which

he himself had given to some one who made inquiry. He enjoyed the play

upon words, softly applauding his own wit. And all the time the poor

helpless outstretched arms of the dead lay close to his dainty boot!

Then another stooped (my heart stopped beating), and picked up a letter

lying on the ground--a letter that had dropped out of M. de Poissy's

pocket--a letter from his wife, full of tender words of endearment and

pretty babblings of love. This was read aloud, with coarse ribald

comments on every sentence, each trying to outdo the previous speaker.

When they came to some pretty words about a sweet Maurice, their little

child away with its mother on some visit, they laughed at M. de la

Tourelle, and told him that he would be hearing such woman's drivelling

some day. Up to that moment, I think, I had only feared him, but his

unnatural, half-ferocious reply made me hate even more than I dreaded

him. But now they grew weary of their savage merriment; the jewels and

watch had been apprised, the money and papers examined; and apparently

there was some necessity for the body being interred quietly and before

daybreak. They had not dared to leave him where he was slain for fear

lest people should come and recognise him, and raise the hue and cry

upon them. For they all along spoke as if it was their constant endeavour

to keep the immediate neighbourhood of Les Rochers in the most orderly

and tranquil condition, so as never to give cause for visits from the

gendarmes. They disputed a little as to whether they should make their

way into the castle larder through the gallery, and satisfy their hunger

before the hasty interment, or afterwards. I listened with eager feverish

interest as soon as this meaning of their speeches reached my hot and

troubled brain, for at the time the words they uttered seemed only to

stamp themselves with terrible force on my memory, so that I could hardly

keep from repeating them aloud like a dull, miserable, unconscious echo;

but my brain was numb to the sense of what they said, unless I myself

were named, and then, I suppose, some instinct of self-preservation

stirred within me, and quickened my sense. And how I strained my ears,

and nerved my hands and limbs, beginning to twitch with convulsive

movements, which I feared might betray me! I gathered every word they

spoke, not knowing which proposal to wish for, but feeling that whatever

was finally decided upon, my only chance of escape was drawing near. I

once feared lest my husband should go to his bedroom before I had had

that one chance, in which case he would most likely have perceived my

absence. He said that his hands were soiled (I shuddered, for it might

be with life-blood), and he would go and cleanse them; but some bitter

jest turned his purpose, and he left the room with the other two--left

it by the gallery door. Left me alone in the dark with the stiffening

corpse!



Now, now was my time, if ever; and yet I could not move. It was not my

cramped and stiffened joints that crippled me, it was the sensation

of that dead man's close presence. I almost fancied--I almost fancy

still--I heard the arm nearest to me move; lift itself up, as if once

more imploring, and fall in dead despair. At that fancy--if fancy it

were--I screamed aloud in mad terror, and the sound of my own strange

voice broke the spell. I drew myself to the side of the table farthest

from the corpse, with as much slow caution as if I really could have

feared the clutch of that poor dead arm, powerless for evermore. I

softly raised myself up, and stood sick and trembling, holding by the

table, too dizzy to know what to do next. I nearly fainted, when a

low voice spoke--when Amante, from the outside of the door, whispered,

""Madame!"" The faithful creature had been on the watch, had heard my

scream, and having seen the three ruffians troop along the gallery down

the stairs, and across the court to the offices in the other wing of the

castle, she had stolen to the door of the room in which I was. The sound

of her voice gave me strength; I walked straight towards it, as one

benighted on a dreary moor, suddenly perceiving the small steady light

which tells of human dwellings, takes heart, and steers straight onward.

Where I was, where that voice was, I knew not; but go to it I must, or

die. The door once opened--I know not by which of us--I fell upon her

neck, grasping her tight, till my hands ached with the tension of their

hold. Yet she never uttered a word. Only she took me up in her vigorous

arms, and bore me to my room, and laid me on my bed. I do not know more;

as soon as I was placed there I lost sense; I came to myself with a

horrible dread lest my husband was by me, with a belief that he was in

the room, in hiding, waiting to hear my first words, watching for the

least sign of the terrible knowledge I possessed to murder me. I dared

not breathe quicker, I measured and timed each heavy inspiration; I did

not speak, nor move, nor even open my eyes, for long after I was in my

full, my miserable senses. I heard some one treading softly about the

room, as if with a purpose, not as if for curiosity, or merely to

beguile the time; some one passed in and out of the salon; and I still

lay quiet, feeling as if death were inevitable, but wishing that the

agony of death were past. Again faintness stole over me; but just as I

was sinking into the horrible feeling of nothingness, I heard Amante's

voice close to me, saying,--



""Drink this, madame, and let us begone. All is ready.""



I let her put her arm under my head and raise me, and pour something

down my throat. All the time she kept talking in a quiet, measured

voice, unlike her own, so dry and authoritative; she told me that a suit

of her clothes lay ready for me, that she herself was as much disguised

as the circumstances permitted her to be, that what provisions I had

left from my supper were stowed away in her pockets, and so she went

on, dwelling on little details of the most commonplace description,

but never alluding for an instant to the fearful cause why flight was

necessary. I made no inquiry as to how she knew, or what she knew. I

never asked her either then or afterwards, I could not bear it--we kept

our dreadful secret close. But I suppose she must have been in the

dressing-room adjoining, and heard all.



In fact, I dared not speak even to her, as if there were anything beyond

the most common event in life in our preparing thus to leave the house

of blood by stealth in the dead of night. She gave me directions--short

condensed directions, without reasons--just as you do to a child; and

like a child I obeyed her. She went often to the door and listened; and

often, too, she went to the window, and looked anxiously out. For me, I

saw nothing but her, and I dared not let my eyes wander from her for a

minute; and I heard nothing in the deep midnight silence but her soft

movements, and the heavy beating of my own heart. At last she took my

hand, and led me in the dark, through the salon, once more into the

terrible gallery, where across the black darkness the windows admitted

pale sheeted ghosts of light upon the floor. Clinging to her I went;

unquestioning--for she was human sympathy to me after the isolation of

my unspeakable terror. On we went, turning to the left instead of to

the right, past my suite of sitting-rooms where the gilding was red

with blood, into that unknown wing of the castle that fronted the main

road lying parallel far below. She guided me along the basement passages

to which we had now descended, until we came to a little open door,

through which the air blew chill and cold, bringing for the first time

a sensation of life to me. The door led into a kind of cellar, through

which we groped our way to an opening like a window, but which, instead

of being glazed, was only fenced with iron bars, two of which were

loose, as Amante evidently knew, for she took them out with the ease of

one who had performed the action often before, and then helped me to

follow her out into the free, open air.



We stole round the end of the building, and on turning the corner--she

first--I felt her hold on me tighten for an instant, and the next step

I, too, heard distant voices, and the blows of a spade upon the heavy

soil, for the night was very warm and still.



We had not spoken a word; we did not speak now. Touch was safer and as

expressive. She turned down towards the high road; I followed. I did not

know the path; we stumbled again and again, and I was much bruised; so

doubtless was she; but bodily pain did me good. At last, we were on the

plainer path of the high road.



I had such faith in her that I did not venture to speak, even when she

paused, as wondering to which hand she should turn. But now, for the

first time, she spoke:--



""Which way did you come when he brought you here first?""



I pointed, I could not speak.



We turned in the opposite direction; still going along the high road.

In about an hour, we struck up to the mountain-side, scrambling far up

before we even dared to rest; far up and away again before day had fully

dawned. Then we looked about for some place of rest and concealment: and

now we dared to speak in whispers. Amante told me that she had locked

the door of communication between his bedroom and mine, and, as in a

dream, I was aware that she had also locked and brought away the key of

the door between the latter and the salon.



""He will have been too busy this night to think much about you--he will

suppose you are asleep--I shall be the first to be missed; but they will

only just now be discovering our loss.""



I remember those last words of hers made me pray to go on; I felt as if

we were losing precious time in thinking either of rest or concealment;

but she hardly replied to me, so busy was she in seeking out some

hiding-place. At length, giving it up in despair, we proceeded onwards a

little way; the mountain-side sloped downwards rapidly, and in the full

morning light we saw ourselves in a narrow valley, made by a stream

which forced its way along it. About a mile lower down there rose the

pale blue smoke of a village, a mill-wheel was lashing up the water

close at hand, though out of sight. Keeping under the cover of every

sheltering tree or bush, we worked our way down past the mill, down to a

one-arched bridge, which doubtless formed part of the road between the

village and the mill.



""This will do,"" said she; and we crept under the space, and climbing a

little way up the rough stone-work, we seated ourselves on a projecting

ledge, and crouched in the deep damp shadow. Amante sat a little above

me, and made me lay my head on her lap. Then she fed me, and took some

food herself; and opening out her great dark cloak, she covered up

every light-coloured speck about us; and thus we sat, shivering and

shuddering, yet feeling a kind of rest through it all, simply from the

fact that motion was no longer imperative, and that during the daylight

our only chance of safety was to be still. But the damp shadow in which

we were sitting was blighting, from the circumstance of the sunlight

never penetrating there; and I dreaded lest, before night and the time

for exertion again came on, I should feel illness creeping all over me.

To add to our discomfort, it had rained the whole day long, and the

stream, fed by a thousand little mountain brooklets, began to swell into

a torrent, rushing over the stones with a perpetual and dizzying noise.



Every now and then I was wakened from the painful doze into which I

continually fell, by a sound of horses' feet over our head: sometimes

lumbering heavily as if dragging a burden, sometimes rattling and

galloping, and with the sharper cry of men's voices coming cutting

through the roar of the waters. At length, day fell. We had to drop into

the stream, which came above our knees as we waded to the bank. There we

stood, stiff and shivering. Even Amante's courage seemed to fail.



""We must pass this night in shelter, somehow,"" said she. For indeed the

rain was coming down pitilessly. I said nothing. I thought that surely

the end must be death in some shape; and I only hoped that to death

might not be added the terror of the cruelty of men. In a minute or so

she had resolved on her course of action. We went up the stream to the

mill. The familiar sounds, the scent of the wheat, the flour whitening

the walls--all reminded me of home, and it seemed to me as if I must

struggle out of this nightmare and waken, and find myself once more a

happy girl by the Neckar-side. They were long in unbarring the door at

which Amante had knocked: at length, an old feeble voice inquired who

was there, and what was sought? Amante answered shelter from the storm

for two women; but the old woman replied, with suspicious hesitation,

that she was sure it was a man who was asking for shelter, and that she

could not let us in. But at length she satisfied herself, and unbarred

the heavy door, and admitted us. She was not an unkindly woman; but her

thoughts all travelled in one circle, and that was, that her master,

the miller, had told her on no account to let any man into the place

during his absence, and that she did not know if he would not think two

women as bad; and yet that as we were not men, no one could say she had

disobeyed him, for it was a shame to let a dog be out such a night as

this. Amante, with ready wit, told her to let no one know that we had

taken shelter there that night, and that then her master could not blame

her; and while she was thus enjoining secrecy as the wisest course, with

a view to far other people than the miller, she was hastily helping me

to take off my wet clothes, and spreading them, as well as the brown

mantle that had covered us both, before the great stove which warmed the

room with the effectual heat that the old woman's failing vitality

required. All this time the poor creature was discussing with herself as

to whether she had disobeyed orders, in a kind of garrulous way that

made me fear much for her capability of retaining anything secret if she

was questioned. By-and-by, she wandered away to an unnecessary revelation

of her master's whereabouts: gone to help in the search for his landlord,

the Sieur de Poissy, who lived at the chteau just above, and who had not

returned from his chase the day before; so the intendant imagined he

might have met with some accident, and had summoned the neighbours to

beat the forest and the hill-side. She told us much besides, giving us

to understand that she would fain meet with a place as housekeeper where

there were more servants and less to do, as her life here was very lonely

and dull, especially since her master's son had gone away--gone to the

wars. She then took her supper, which was evidently apportioned out to

her with a sparing hand, as, even if the idea had come into her head,

she had not enough to offer us any. Fortunately, warmth was all that

we required, and that, thanks to Amante's cares, was returning to our

chilled bodies. After supper, the old woman grew drowsy; but she seemed

uncomfortable at the idea of going to sleep and leaving us still in the

house. Indeed, she gave us pretty broad hints as to the propriety of our

going once more out into the bleak and stormy night; but we begged to be

allowed to stay under shelter of some kind; and, at last, a bright idea

came over her, and she bade us mount by a ladder to a kind of loft, which

went half over the lofty mill-kitchen in which we were sitting. We

obeyed her--what else could we do?--and found ourselves in a spacious

floor, without any safeguard or wall, boarding, or railing, to keep us

from falling over into the kitchen in case we went too near the edge. It

was, in fact, the store-room or garret for the household. There was

bedding piled up, boxes and chests, mill sacks, the winter store of

apples and nuts, bundles of old clothes, broken furniture, and many

other things. No sooner were we up there, than the old woman dragged

the ladder, by which we had ascended, away with a chuckle, as if she was

now secure that we could do no mischief, and sat herself down again once

more, to doze and await her master's return. We pulled out some bedding,

and gladly laid ourselves down in our dried clothes and in some warmth,

hoping to have the sleep we so much needed to refresh us and prepare us

for the next day. But I could not sleep, and I was aware, from her

breathing, that Amante was equally wakeful. We could both see through

the crevices between the boards that formed the flooring into the

kitchen below, very partially lighted by the common lamp that hung

against the wall near the stove on the opposite side to that on which we

were.





PORTION III.



Far on in the night there were voices outside reached us in our

hiding-place; an angry knocking at the door, and we saw through the

chinks the old woman rouse herself up to go and open it for her master,

who came in, evidently half drunk. To my sick horror, he was followed

by Lefebvre, apparently as sober and wily as ever. They were talking

together as they came in, disputing about something; but the miller

stopped the conversation to swear at the old woman for having fallen

asleep, and, with tipsy anger, and even with blows, drove the poor

old creature out of the kitchen to bed. Then he and Lefebvre went on

talking--about the Sieur de Poissy's disappearance. It seemed that

Lefebvre had been out all day, along with other of my husband's men,

ostensibly assisting in the search; in all probability trying to blind

the Sieur de Poissy's followers by putting them on a wrong scent, and

also, I fancied, from one or two of Lefebvre's sly questions, combining

the hidden purpose of discovering us.



Although the miller was tenant and vassal to the Sieur de Poissy, he

seemed to me to be much more in league with the people of M. de la

Tourelle. He was evidently aware, in part, of the life which Lefebvre

and the others led; although, again, I do not suppose he knew or

imagined one-half of their crimes; and also, I think, he was seriously

interested in discovering the fate of his master, little suspecting

Lefebvre of murder or violence. He kept talking himself, and letting out

all sorts of thoughts and opinions; watched by the keen eyes of Lefebvre

gleaming out below his shaggy eyebrows. It was evidently not the cue of

the latter to let out that his master's wife had escaped from that vile

and terrible den; but though he never breathed a word relating to us,

not the less was I certain he was thirsting for our blood, and lying in

wait for us at every turn of events. Presently he got up and took his

leave; and the miller bolted him out, and stumbled off to bed. Then we

fell asleep, and slept sound and long.



The next morning, when I awoke, I saw Amante, half raised, resting on

one hand, and eagerly gazing, with straining eyes, into the kitchen

below. I looked too, and both heard and saw the miller and two of his

men eagerly and loudly talking about the old woman, who had not appeared

as usual to make the fire in the stove, and prepare her master's

breakfast, and who now, late on in the morning, had been found dead in

her bed; whether from the effect of her master's blows the night before,

or from natural causes, who can tell? The miller's conscience upbraided

him a little, I should say, for he was eagerly declaring his value for

his housekeeper, and repeating how often she had spoken of the happy

life she led with him. The men might have their doubts, but they did

not wish to offend the miller, and all agreed that the necessary steps

should be taken for a speedy funeral. And so they went out, leaving

us in our loft, but so much alone, that, for the first time almost,

we ventured to speak freely, though still in a hushed voice, pausing

to listen continually. Amante took a more cheerful view of the whole

occurrence than I did. She said that, had the old woman lived, we should

have had to depart that morning, and that this quiet departure would

have been the best thing we could have had to hope for, as, in all

probability, the housekeeper would have told her master of us and of

our resting-place, and this fact would, sooner or later, have been

brought to the knowledge of those from whom we most desired to keep it

concealed; but that now we had time to rest, and a shelter to rest in,

during the first hot pursuit, which we knew to a fatal certainty was

being carried on. The remnants of our food, and the stored-up fruit,

would supply us with provision; the only thing to be feared was, that

something might be required from the loft, and the miller or some one

else mount up in search of it. But even then, with a little arrangement

of boxes and chests, one part might be so kept in shadow that we might

yet escape observation. All this comforted me a little; but, I asked,

how were we ever to escape? The ladder was taken away, which was

our only means of descent. But Amante replied that she could make a

sufficient ladder of the rope lying coiled among other things, to drop

us down the ten feet or so--with the advantage of its being portable, so

that we might carry it away, and thus avoid all betrayal of the fact

that any one had ever been hidden in the loft.



During the two days that intervened before we did escape, Amante made

good use of her time. She looked into every box and chest during the

man's absence at his mill; and finding in one box an old suit of man's

clothes, which had probably belonged to the miller's absent son, she put

them on to see if they would fit her; and, when she found that they did,

she cut her own hair to the shortness of a man's, made me clip her black

eyebrows as close as though they had been shaved, and by cutting up old

corks into pieces such as would go into her cheeks, she altered both the

shape of her face and her voice to a degree which I should not have

believed possible.



All this time I lay like one stunned; my body resting, and renewing its

strength, but I myself in an almost idiotic state--else surely I could

not have taken the stupid interest which I remember I did in all Amante's

energetic preparations for disguise. I absolutely recollect once the

feeling of a smile coming over my stiff face as some new exercise of her

cleverness proved a success.



But towards the second day, she required me, too, to exert myself; and

then all my heavy despair returned. I let her dye my fair hair and

complexion with the decaying shells of the stored-up walnuts, I let her

blacken my teeth, and even voluntarily broke a front tooth the better

to effect my disguise. But through it all I had no hope of evading my

terrible husband. The third night the funeral was over, the drinking

ended, the guests gone; the miller put to bed by his men, being too

drunk to help himself. They stopped a little while in the kitchen,

talking and laughing about the new housekeeper likely to come; and they,

too, went off, shutting, but not locking the door. Everything favoured

us. Amante had tried her ladder on one of the two previous nights, and

could, by a dexterous throw from beneath, unfasten it from the hook to

which it was fixed, when it had served its office; she made up a bundle

of worthless old clothes in order that we might the better preserve our

characters of a travelling pedlar and his wife; she stuffed a hump on

her back, she thickened my figure, she left her own clothes deep down

beneath a heap of others in the chest from which she had taken the man's

dress which she wore; and with a few francs in her pocket--the sole

money we had either of us had about us when we escaped--we let ourselves

down the ladder, unhooked it, and passed into the cold darkness of night

again.



We had discussed the route which it would be well for us to take while

we lay perdues in our loft. Amante had told me then that her reason for

inquiring, when we first left Les Rochers, by which way I had first been

brought to it, was to avoid the pursuit which she was sure would first

be made in the direction of Germany; but that now she thought we might

return to that district of country where my German fashion of speaking

French would excite least observation. I thought that Amante herself had

something peculiar in her accent, which I had heard M. de la Tourelle

sneer at as Norman patois; but I said not a word beyond agreeing to her

proposal that we should bend our steps towards Germany. Once there, we

should, I thought, be safe. Alas! I forgot the unruly time that was

overspreading all Europe, overturning all law, and all the protection

which law gives.



How we wandered--not daring to ask our way--how we lived, how we struggled

through many a danger and still more terrors of danger, I shall not tell

you now. I will only relate two of our adventures before we reached

Frankfort. The first, although fatal to an innocent lady, was yet, I

believe, the cause of my safety; the second I shall tell you, that you

may understand why I did not return to my former home, as I had hoped to

do when we lay in the miller's loft, and I first became capable of

groping after an idea of what my future life might be. I cannot tell you

how much in these doubtings and wanderings I became attached to Amante.

I have sometimes feared since, lest I cared for her only because she was

so necessary to my own safety; but, no! it was not so; or not so only,

or principally. She said once that she was flying for her own life as

well as for mine; but we dared not speak much on our danger, or on the

horrors that had gone before. We planned a little what was to be our

future course; but even for that we did not look forward long; how could

we, when every day we scarcely knew if we should see the sun go down?

For Amante knew or conjectured far more than I did of the atrocity of

the gang to which M. de la Tourelle belonged; and every now and then,

just as we seemed to be sinking into the calm of security, we fell upon

traces of a pursuit after us in all directions. Once I remember--we must

have been nearly three weeks wearily walking through unfrequented ways,

day after day, not daring to make inquiry as to our whereabouts, nor

yet to seem purposeless in our wanderings--we came to a kind of lonely

roadside farrier's and blacksmith's. I was so tired, that Amante

declared that, come what might, we would stay there all night; and

accordingly she entered the house, and boldly announced herself as a

travelling tailor, ready to do any odd jobs of work that might be

required, for a night's lodging and food for herself and wife. She had

adopted this plan once or twice before, and with good success; for her

father had been a tailor in Rouen, and as a girl she had often helped

him with his work, and knew the tailors' slang and habits, down to the

particular whistle and cry which in France tells so much to those of a

trade. At this blacksmith's, as at most other solitary houses far away

from a town, there was not only a store of men's clothes laid by as

wanting mending when the housewife could afford time, but there was a

natural craving after news from a distance, such news as a wandering

tailor is bound to furnish. The early November afternoon was closing

into evening, as we sat down, she cross-legged on the great table in the

blacksmith's kitchen, drawn close to the window, I close behind her,

sewing at another part of the same garment, and from time to time well

scolded by my seeming husband. All at once she turned round to speak to

me. It was only one word, ""Courage!"" I had seen nothing; I sat out of

the light; but I turned sick for an instant, and then I braced myself up

into a strange strength of endurance to go through I knew not what.



The blacksmith's forge was in a shed beside the house, and fronting the

road. I heard the hammers stop plying their continual rhythmical beat.

She had seen why they ceased. A rider had come up to the forge and

dismounted, leading his horse in to be re-shod. The broad red light of

the forge-fire had revealed the face of the rider to Amante, and she

apprehended the consequence that really ensued.



The rider, after some words with the blacksmith, was ushered in by him

into the house-place where we sat.



""Here, good wife, a cup of wine and some galette for this gentleman.""



""Anything, anything, madame, that I can eat and drink in my hand while

my horse is being shod. I am in haste, and must get on to Forbach

to-night.""



The blacksmith's wife lighted her lamp; Amante had asked her for it five

minutes before. How thankful we were that she had not more speedily

complied with our request! As it was, we sat in dusk shadow, pretending

to stitch away, but scarcely able to see. The lamp was placed on the

stove, near which my husband, for it was he, stood and warmed himself.

By-and-by he turned round, and looked all over the room, taking us in

with about the same degree of interest as the inanimate furniture.

Amante, cross-legged, fronting him, stooped over her work, whistling

softly all the while. He turned again to the stove, impatiently rubbing

his hands. He had finished his wine and galette, and wanted to be off.



""I am in haste, my good woman. Ask thy husband to get on more quickly. I

will pay him double if he makes haste.""



The woman went out to do his bidding; and he once more turned round to

face us. Amante went on to the second part of the tune. He took it up,

whistled a second for an instant or so, and then the blacksmith's wife

re-entering, he moved towards her, as if to receive her answer the more

speedily.



""One moment, monsieur--only one moment. There was a nail out of the

off-foreshoe which my husband is replacing; it would delay monsieur

again if that shoe also came off.""



""Madame is right,"" said he, ""but my haste is urgent. If madame knew

my reasons, she would pardon my impatience. Once a happy husband, now

a deserted and betrayed man, I pursue a wife on whom I lavished all

my love, but who has abused my confidence, and fled from my house,

doubtless to some paramour; carrying off with her all the jewels and

money on which she could lay her hands. It is possible madame may have

heard or seen something of her; she was accompanied in her flight by

a base, profligate woman from Paris, whom I, unhappy man, had myself

engaged for my wife's waiting-maid, little dreaming what corruption I

was bringing into my house!""



""Is it possible?"" said the good woman, throwing up her hands.



Amante went on whistling a little lower, out of respect to the

conversation.



""However, I am tracing the wicked fugitives; I am on their track"" (and

the handsome, effeminate face looked as ferocious as any demon's). ""They

will not escape me; but every minute is a minute of misery to me, till I

meet my wife. Madame has sympathy, has she not?""



He drew his face into a hard, unnatural smile, and then both went out to

the forge, as if once more to hasten the blacksmith over his work.



Amante stopped her whistling for one instant.



""Go on as you are, without change of an eyelid even; in a few minutes he

will be gone, and it will be over!""



It was a necessary caution, for I was on the point of giving way, and

throwing myself weakly upon her neck. We went on; she whistling and

stitching, I making semblance to sew. And it was well we did so; for

almost directly he came back for his whip, which he had laid down and

forgotten; and again I felt one of those sharp, quick-scanning glances,

sent all round the room, and taking in all.



Then we heard him ride away; and then, it had been long too dark to see

well, I dropped my work, and gave way to my trembling and shuddering.

The blacksmith's wife returned. She was a good creature. Amante told her

I was cold and weary, and she insisted on my stopping my work, and going

to sit near the stove; hastening, at the same time, her preparations for

supper, which, in honour of us, and of monsieur's liberal payment, was

to be a little less frugal than ordinary. It was well for me that she

made me taste a little of the cider-soup she was preparing, or I could

not have held up, in spite of Amante's warning look, and the remembrance

of her frequent exhortations to act resolutely up to the characters we

had assumed, whatever befel. To cover my agitation, Amante stopped her

whistling, and began to talk; and, by the time the blacksmith came in,

she and the good woman of the house were in full flow. He began at once

upon the handsome gentleman, who had paid him so well; all his sympathy

was with him, and both he and his wife only wished he might overtake his

wicked wife, and punish her as she deserved. And then the conversation

took a turn, not uncommon to those whose lives are quiet and monotonous;

every one seemed to vie with each other in telling about some horror;

and the savage and mysterious band of robbers called the Chauffeurs,

who infested all the roads leading to the Rhine, with Schinderhannes at

their head, furnished many a tale which made the very marrow of my bones

run cold, and quenched even Amante's power of talking. Her eyes grew

large and wild, her cheeks blanched, and for once she sought by her

looks help from me. The new call upon me roused me. I rose and said,

with their permission my husband and I would seek our bed, for that we

had travelled far and were early risers. I added that we would get up

betimes, and finish our piece of work. The blacksmith said we should

be early birds if we rose before him; and the good wife seconded my

proposal with kindly bustle. One other such story as those they had been

relating, and I do believe Amante would have fainted.



As it was, a night's rest set her up; we arose and finished our work

betimes, and shared the plentiful breakfast of the family. Then we had

to set forth again; only knowing that to Forbach we must not go, yet

believing, as was indeed the case, that Forbach lay between us and that

Germany to which we were directing our course. Two days more we wandered

on, making a round, I suspect, and returning upon the road to Forbach, a

league or two nearer to that town than the blacksmith's house. But as we

never made inquiries I hardly knew where we were, when we came one night

to a small town, with a good large rambling inn in the very centre of

the principal street. We had begun to feel as if there were more safety

in towns than in the loneliness of the country. As we had parted with a

ring of mine not many days before to a travelling jeweller, who was too

glad to purchase it far below its real value to make many inquiries as

to how it came into the possession of a poor working tailor, such as

Amante seemed to be, we resolved to stay at this inn all night, and

gather such particulars and information as we could by which to direct

our onward course.



We took our supper in the darkest corner of the _salle--manger_, having

previously bargained for a small bedroom across the court, and over the

stables. We needed food sorely; but we hurried on our meal from dread of

any one entering that public room who might recognize us. Just in the

middle of our meal, the public diligence drove lumbering up under the

_porte-cochre_, and disgorged its passengers. Most of them turned into

the room where we sat, cowering and fearful, for the door was opposite

to the porter's lodge, and both opened on to the wide-covered entrance

from the street. Among the passengers came in a young, fair-haired lady,

attended by an elderly French maid. The poor young creature tossed her

head, and shrank away from the common room, full of evil smells and

promiscuous company, and demanded, in German French, to be taken to

some private apartment. We heard that she and her maid had come in the

coup, and, probably from pride, poor young lady! she had avoided all

association with her fellow-passengers, thereby exciting their dislike

and ridicule. All these little pieces of hearsay had a significance to

us afterwards, though, at the time, the only remark made that bore upon

the future was Amante's whisper to me that the young lady's hair was

exactly the colour of mine, which she had cut off and burnt in the stove

in the miller's kitchen in one of her descents from our hiding-place in

the loft.



As soon as we could, we struck round in the shadow, leaving the

boisterous and merry fellow-passengers to their supper. We crossed the

court, borrowed a lantern from the ostler, and scrambled up the rude

steps to our chamber above the stable. There was no door into it; the

entrance was the hole into which the ladder fitted. The window looked

into the court. We were tired and soon fell asleep. I was wakened by a

noise in the stable below. One instant of listening, and I wakened

Amante, placing my hand on her mouth, to prevent any exclamation in her

half-roused state. We heard my husband speaking about his horse to the

ostler. It was his voice. I am sure of it. Amante said so too. We durst

not move to rise and satisfy ourselves. For five minutes or so he went

on giving directions. Then he left the stable, and, softly stealing

to our window, we saw him cross the court and re-enter the inn. We

consulted as to what we should do. We feared to excite remark or

suspicion by descending and leaving our chamber, or else immediate

escape was our strongest idea. Then the ostler left the stable, locking

the door on the outside.



""We must try and drop through the window--if, indeed, it is well to go

at all,"" said Amante.



With reflection came wisdom. We should excite suspicion by leaving

without paying our bill. We were on foot, and might easily be pursued.

So we sat on our bed's edge, talking and shivering, while from across

the court the laughter rang merrily, and the company slowly dispersed

one by one, their lights flitting past the windows as they went upstairs

and settled each one to his rest.



We crept into our bed, holding each other tight, and listening to every

sound, as if we thought we were tracked, and might meet our death at any

moment. In the dead of night, just at the profound stillness preceding

the turn into another day, we heard a soft, cautious step crossing

the yard. The key into the stable was turned--some one came into the

stable--we felt rather than heard him there. A horse started a little,

and made a restless movement with his feet, then whinnied recognition.

He who had entered made two or three low sounds to the animal, and then

led him into the court. Amante sprang to the window with the noiseless

activity of a cat. She looked out, but dared not speak a word. We heard

the great door into the street open--a pause for mounting, and the

horse's footsteps were lost in distance.



Then Amante came back to me. ""It was he! he is gone!"" said she, and once

more we lay down, trembling and shaking.



This time we fell sound asleep. We slept long and late. We were wakened

by many hurrying feet, and many confused voices; all the world seemed

awake and astir. We rose and dressed ourselves, and coming down we

looked around among the crowd collected in the court-yard, in order to

assure ourselves _he_ was not there before we left the shelter of the

stable.



The instant we were seen, two or three people rushed to us.



""Have you heard?--Do you know?--That poor young lady--oh, come and see!""

and so we were hurried, almost in spite of ourselves, across the court,

and up the great open stairs of the main building of the inn, into a

bed-chamber, where lay the beautiful young German lady, so full of

graceful pride the night before, now white and still in death. By her

stood the French maid, crying and gesticulating.



""Oh, madame! if you had but suffered me to stay with you! Oh! the baron,

what will he say?"" and so she went on. Her state had but just been

discovered; it had been supposed that she was fatigued, and was sleeping

late, until a few minutes before. The surgeon of the town had been sent

for, and the landlord of the inn was trying vainly to enforce order

until he came, and, from time to time, drinking little cups of brandy,

and offering them to the guests, who were all assembled there, pretty

much as the servants were doing in the court-yard.



At last the surgeon came. All fell back, and hung on the words that were

to fall from his lips.



""See!"" said the landlord. ""This lady came last night by the diligence

with her maid. Doubtless a great lady, for she must have a private

sitting-room----""



""She was Madame the Baroness de Roeder,"" said the French maid.



--""And was difficult to please in the matter of supper, and a

sleeping-room. She went to bed well, though fatigued. Her maid left

her----""



""I begged to be allowed to sleep in her room, as we were in a strange

inn, of the character of which we knew nothing; but she would not let

me, my mistress was such a great lady.""



--""And slept with my servants,"" continued the landlord. ""This morning we

thought madame was still slumbering; but when eight, nine, ten, and near

eleven o'clock came, I bade her maid use my pass-key, and enter her

room----""



""The door was not locked, only closed. And here she was found--dead is

she not, monsieur?--with her face down on her pillow, and her beautiful

hair all scattered wild; she never would let me tie it up, saying it

made her head ache. Such hair!"" said the waiting-maid, lifting up a long

golden tress, and letting it fall again.



I remembered Amante's words the night before, and crept close up to her.



Meanwhile, the doctor was examining the body underneath the bed-clothes,

which the landlord, until now, had not allowed to be disarranged. The

surgeon drew out his hand, all bathed and stained with blood; and

holding up a short, sharp knife, with a piece of paper fastened round

it.



""Here has been foul play,"" he said. ""The deceased lady has been

murdered. This dagger was aimed straight at her heart."" Then, putting on

his spectacles, he read the writing on the bloody paper, dimmed and

horribly obscured as it was:--



  NUMRO UN.

  Ainsi les Chauffeurs se vengent.





""Let us go!"" said I to Amante. ""Oh, let us leave this horrible place!""



""Wait a little,"" said she. ""Only a few minutes more. It will be better.""



Immediately the voices of all proclaimed their suspicions of the

cavalier who had arrived last the night before. He had, they said, made

so many inquiries about the young lady, whose supercilious conduct all

in the _salle--manger_ had been discussing on his entrance. They were

talking about her as we left the room; he must have come in directly

afterwards, and not until he had learnt all about her, had he spoken of

the business which necessitated his departure at dawn of day, and made

his arrangements with both landlord and ostler for the possession of the

keys of the stable and _porte-cochre_. In short, there was no doubt as

to the murderer, even before the arrival of the legal functionary who

had been sent for by the surgeon; but the word on the paper chilled

every one with terror. Les Chauffeurs, who were they? No one knew, some

of the gang might even then be in the room overhearing, and noting down

fresh objects for vengeance. In Germany, I had heard little of this

terrible gang, and I had paid no greater heed to the stories related

once or twice about them in Carlsruhe than one does to tales about

ogres. But here in their very haunts, I learnt the full amount of the

terror they inspired. No one would be legally responsible for any

evidence criminating the murderer. The public prosecutor shrank from the

duties of his office. What do I say? Neither Amante nor I, knowing far

more of the actual guilt of the man who had killed that poor sleeping

young lady, durst breathe a word. We appeared to be wholly ignorant of

everything: we, who might have told so much. But how could we? we were

broken down with terrific anxiety and fatigue, with the knowledge that

we, above all, were doomed victims; and that the blood, heavily dripping

from the bed-clothes on to the floor, was dripping thus out of the poor

dead body, because, when living, she had been mistaken for me.



At length Amante went up to the landlord, and asked permission to leave

his inn, doing all openly and humbly, so as to excite neither ill-will

nor suspicion. Indeed, suspicion was otherwise directed, and he willingly

gave us leave to depart. A few days afterwards we were across the Rhine,

in Germany, making our way towards Frankfort, but still keeping our

disguises, and Amante still working at her trade.



On the way, we met a young man, a wandering journeyman from Heidelberg.

I knew him, although I did not choose that he should know me. I asked

him, as carelessly as I could, how the old miller was now? He told me he

was dead. This realization of the worst apprehensions caused by his long

silence shocked me inexpressibly. It seemed as though every prop gave

way from under me. I had been talking to Amante only that very day of

the safety and comfort of the home that awaited her in my father's

house; of the gratitude which the old man would feel towards her; and

how there, in that peaceful dwelling, far away from the terrible land

of France, she should find ease and security for all the rest of her

life. All this I thought I had to promise, and even yet more had I

looked for, for myself. I looked to the unburdening of my heart and

conscience by telling all I knew to my best and wisest friend. I looked

to his love as a sure guidance as well as a comforting stay, and,

behold, he was gone away from me for ever!



I had left the room hastily on hearing of this sad news from the

Heidelberger. Presently, Amante followed:



""Poor madame,"" said she, consoling me to the best of her ability. And

then she told me by degrees what more she had learned respecting my

home, about which she knew almost as much as I did, from my frequent

talks on the subject both at Les Rochers and on the dreary, doleful road

we had come along. She had continued the conversation after I left, by

asking about my brother and his wife. Of course, they lived on at the

mill, but the man said (with what truth I know not, but I believed it

firmly at the time) that Babette had completely got the upper hand of my

brother, who only saw through her eyes and heard with her ears. That

there had been much Heidelberg gossip of late days about her sudden

intimacy with a grand French gentleman who had appeared at the mill--a

relation, by marriage--married, in fact, to the miller's sister, who,

by all accounts, had behaved abominably and ungratefully. But that was

no reason for Babette's extreme and sudden intimacy with him, going

about everywhere with the French gentleman; and since he left (as the

Heidelberger said he knew for a fact) corresponding with him constantly.

Yet her husband saw no harm in it all, seemingly; though, to be sure, he

was so out of spirits, what with his father's death and the news of his

sister's infamy, that he hardly knew how to hold up his head.



""Now,"" said Amante, ""all this proves that M. de la Tourelle has

suspected that you would go back to the nest in which you were reared,

and that he has been there, and found that you have not yet returned;

but probably he still imagines that you will do so, and has accordingly

engaged your sister-in-law as a kind of informant. Madame has said that

her sister-in-law bore her no extreme good-will; and the defamatory

story he has got the start of us in spreading, will not tend to increase

the favour in which your sister-in-law holds you. No doubt the assassin

was retracing his steps when we met him near Forbach, and having heard

of the poor German lady, with her French maid, and her pretty blonde

complexion, he followed her. If madame will still be guided by me--and,

my child, I beg of you still to trust me,"" said Amante, breaking out of

her respectful formality into the way of talking more natural to those

who had shared and escaped from common dangers--more natural, too, where

the speaker was conscious of a power of protection which the other did

not possess--""we will go on to Frankfort, and lose ourselves, for a

time, at least, in the numbers of people who throng a great town; and

you have told me that Frankfort is a great town. We will still be

husband and wife; we will take a small lodging, and you shall housekeep

and live in-doors. I, as the rougher and the more alert, will continue

my father's trade, and seek work at the tailors' shops.""



I could think of no better plan, so we followed this out. In a back

street at Frankfort we found two furnished rooms to let on a sixth

story. The one we entered had no light from day; a dingy lamp swung

perpetually from the ceiling, and from that, or from the open door

leading into the bedroom beyond, came our only light. The bedroom was

more cheerful, but very small. Such as it was, it almost exceeded our

possible means. The money from the sale of my ring was almost exhausted,

and Amante was a stranger in the place, speaking only French, moreover,

and the good Germans were hating the French people right heartily.

However, we succeeded better than our hopes, and even laid by a little

against the time of my confinement. I never stirred abroad, and saw no

one, and Amante's want of knowledge of German kept her in a state of

comparative isolation.



At length my child was born--my poor worse than fatherless child. It

was a girl, as I had prayed for. I had feared lest a boy might have

something of the tiger nature of its father, but a girl seemed all my

own. And yet not all my own, for the faithful Amante's delight and glory

in the babe almost exceeded mine; in outward show it certainly did.



We had not been able to afford any attendance beyond what a neighbouring

sage-femme could give, and she came frequently, bringing in with her

a little store of gossip, and wonderful tales culled out of her own

experience, every time. One day she began to tell me about a great lady

in whose service her daughter had lived as scullion, or some such

thing. Such a beautiful lady! with such a handsome husband. But grief

comes to the palace as well as to the garret, and why or wherefore no

one knew, but somehow the Baron de Roeder must have incurred the

vengeance of the terrible Chauffeurs; for not many months ago, as

madame was going to see her relations in Alsace, she was stabbed dead

as she lay in bed at some hotel on the road. Had I not seen it in the

_Gazette_? Had I not heard? Why, she had been told that as far off as

Lyons there were placards offering a heavy reward on the part of the

Baron de Roeder for information respecting the murderer of his wife. But

no one could help him, for all who could bear evidence were in such

terror of the Chauffeurs; there were hundreds of them she had been told,

rich and poor, great gentlemen and peasants, all leagued together by

most frightful oaths to hunt to the death any one who bore witness

against them; so that even they who survived the tortures to which the

Chauffeurs subjected many of the people whom they plundered, dared not

to recognise them again, would not dare, even did they see them at the

bar of a court of justice; for, if one were condemned, were there not

hundreds sworn to avenge his death?



I told all this to Amante, and we began to fear that if M. de la

Tourelle, or Lefebvre, or any of the gang at Les Rochers, had seen these

placards, they would know that the poor lady stabbed by the former was

the Baroness de Roeder, and that they would set forth again in search of

me.



This fresh apprehension told on my health and impeded my recovery. We

had so little money we could not call in a physician, at least, not one

in established practice. But Amante found out a young doctor for whom,

indeed, she had sometimes worked; and offering to pay him in kind, she

brought him to see me, her sick wife. He was very gentle and thoughtful,

though, like ourselves, very poor. But he gave much time and consideration

to the case, saying once to Amante that he saw my constitution had

experienced some severe shock from which it was probable that my nerves

would never entirely recover. By-and-by I shall name this doctor, and

then you will know, better than I can describe, his character.



I grew strong in time--stronger, at least. I was able to work a little

at home, and to sun myself and my baby at the garret-window in the roof.

It was all the air I dared to take. I constantly wore the disguise I had

first set out with; as constantly had I renewed the disfiguring dye

which changed my hair and complexion. But the perpetual state of terror

in which I had been during the whole months succeeding my escape from

Les Rochers made me loathe the idea of ever again walking in the open

daylight, exposed to the sight and recognition of every passer-by. In

vain Amante reasoned--in vain the doctor urged. Docile in every other

thing, in this I was obstinate. I would not stir out. One day Amante

returned from her work, full of news--some of it good, some such as to

cause us apprehension. The good news was this; the master for whom she

worked as journeyman was going to send her with some others to a great

house at the other side of Frankfort, where there were to be private

theatricals, and where many new dresses and much alteration of old ones

would be required. The tailors employed were all to stay at this house

until the day of representation was over, as it was at some distance

from the town, and no one could tell when their work would be ended.

But the pay was to be proportionately good.



The other thing she had to say was this: she had that day met the

travelling jeweller to whom she and I had sold my ring. It was rather a

peculiar one, given to me by my husband; we had felt at the time that it

might be the means of tracing us, but we were penniless and starving,

and what else could we do? She had seen that this Frenchman had recognised

her at the same instant that she did him, and she thought at the same

time that there was a gleam of more than common intelligence on his face

as he did so. This idea had been confirmed by his following her for some

way on the other side of the street; but she had evaded him with her

better knowledge of the town, and the increasing darkness of the night.

Still it was well that she was going to such a distance from our

dwelling on the next day; and she had brought me in a stock of provisions,

begging me to keep within doors, with a strange kind of fearful oblivion

of the fact that I had never set foot beyond the threshold of the house

since I had first entered it--scarce ever ventured down the stairs. But,

although my poor, my dear, very faithful Amante was like one possessed

that last night, she spoke continually of the dead, which is a bad

sign for the living. She kissed you--yes! it was you, my daughter, my

darling, whom I bore beneath my bosom away from the fearful castle of

your father--I call him so for the first time, I must call him so once

again before I have done--Amante kissed you, sweet baby, blessed little

comforter, as if she never could leave off. And then she went away,

alive.



Two days, three days passed away. That third evening I was sitting

within my bolted doors--you asleep on your pillow by my side--when a

step came up the stair, and I knew it must be for me; for ours were the

topmost rooms. Some one knocked; I held my very breath. But some one

spoke, and I knew it was the good Doctor Voss. Then I crept to the door,

and answered.



""Are you alone?"" asked I.



""Yes,"" said he, in a still lower voice. ""Let me in."" I let him in, and

he was as alert as I in bolting and barring the door. Then he came and

whispered to me his doleful tale. He had come from the hospital in the

opposite quarter of the town, the hospital which he visited; he should

have been with me sooner, but he had feared lest he should be watched.

He had come from Amante's death-bed. Her fears of the jeweller were

too well founded. She had left the house where she was employed that

morning, to transact some errand connected with her work in the town;

she must have been followed, and dogged on her way back through solitary

wood-paths, for some of the wood-rangers belonging to the great house

had found her lying there, stabbed to death, but not dead; with the

poniard again plunged through the fatal writing, once more; but this

time with the word ""un"" underlined, so as to show that the assassin was

aware of his previous mistake.



  Numro _Un_.

  Ainsi les Chauffeurs se vengent.



They had carried her to the house, and given her restoratives till she

had recovered the feeble use of her speech. But, oh, faithful, dear

friend and sister! even then she remembered me, and refused to tell

(what no one else among her fellow workmen knew), where she lived or

with whom. Life was ebbing away fast, and they had no resource but to

carry her to the nearest hospital, where, of course, the fact of her

sex was made known. Fortunately both for her and for me, the doctor in

attendance was the very Doctor Voss whom we already knew. To him, while

awaiting her confessor, she told enough to enable him to understand the

position in which I was left; before the priest had heard half her tale

Amante was dead.



Doctor Voss told me he had made all sorts of _dtours_, and waited thus,

late at night, for fear of being watched and followed. But I do not

think he was. At any rate, as I afterwards learnt from him, the Baron

Roeder, on hearing of the similitude of this murder with that of his

wife in every particular, made such a search after the assassins, that,

although they were not discovered, they were compelled to take to flight

for the time.



I can hardly tell you now by what arguments Dr. Voss, at first merely

my benefactor, sparing me a portion of his small modicum, at length

persuaded me to become his wife. His wife he called it, I called it; for

we went through the religious ceremony too much slighted at the time,

and as we were both Lutherans, and M. de la Tourelle had pretended to be

of the reformed religion, a divorce from the latter would have been

easily procurable by German law both ecclesiastical and legal, could we

have summoned so fearful a man into any court.



The good doctor took me and my child by stealth to his modest dwelling;

and there I lived in the same deep retirement, never seeing the full

light of day, although when the dye had once passed away from my face my

husband did not wish me to renew it. There was no need; my yellow hair

was grey, my complexion was ashen-coloured, no creature could have

recognized the fresh-coloured, bright-haired young woman of eighteen

months before. The few people whom I saw knew me only as Madame Voss; a

widow much older than himself, whom Dr. Voss had secretly married. They

called me the Grey Woman.



He made me give you his surname. Till now you have known no other

father--while he lived you needed no father's love. Once only, only once

more, did the old terror come upon me. For some reason which I forget,

I broke through my usual custom, and went to the window of my room for

some purpose, either to shut or to open it. Looking out into the street

for an instant, I was fascinated by the sight of M. de la Tourelle, gay,

young, elegant as ever, walking along on the opposite side of the

street. The noise I had made with the window caused him to look up; he

saw me, an old grey woman, and he did not recognize me! Yet it was not

three years since we had parted, and his eyes were keen and dreadful

like those of the lynx.



I told M. Voss, on his return home, and he tried to cheer me, but the

shock of seeing M. de la Tourelle had been too terrible for me. I was

ill for long months afterwards.



Once again I saw him. Dead. He and Lefebvre were at last caught; hunted

down by the Baron de Roeder in some of their crimes. Dr. Voss had heard

of their arrest; their condemnation, their death; but he never said a

word to me, until one day he bade me show him that I loved him by my

obedience and my trust. He took me a long carriage journey, where to I

know not, for we never spoke of that day again; I was led through a

prison, into a closed court-yard, where, decently draped in the last

robes of death, concealing the marks of decapitation, lay M. de la

Tourelle, and two or three others, whom I had known at Les Rochers.



After that conviction Dr. Voss tried to persuade me to return to a more

natural mode of life, and to go out more. But although I sometimes

complied with his wish, yet the old terror was ever strong upon me,

and he, seeing what an effort it was, gave up urging me at last.



You know all the rest. How we both mourned bitterly the loss of that

dear husband and father--for such I will call him ever--and as such

you must consider him, my child, after this one revelation is over.



Why has it been made, you ask. For this reason, my child. The lover,

whom you have only known as M. Lebrun, a French artist, told me but

yesterday his real name, dropped because the blood-thirsty republicans

might consider it as too aristocratic. It is Maurice de Poissy.









CURIOUS IF TRUE.



(EXTRACT FROM A LETTER FROM RICHARD WHITTINGHAM, ESQ.)





You were formerly so much amused at my pride in my descent from that

sister of Calvin's, who married a Whittingham, Dean of Durham, that I

doubt if you will be able to enter into the regard for my distinguished

relation that has led me to France, in order to examine registers and

archives, which, I thought, might enable me to discover collateral

descendants of the great reformer, with whom I might call cousins. I

shall not tell you of my troubles and adventures in this research; you

are not worthy to hear of them; but something so curious befel me one

evening last August, that if I had not been perfectly certain I was wide

awake, I might have taken it for a dream.



For the purpose I have named, it was necessary that I should make Tours

my head-quarters for a time. I had traced descendants of the Calvin

family out of Normandy into the centre of France; but I found it was

necessary to have a kind of permission from the bishop of the diocese

before I could see certain family papers, which had fallen into the

possession of the Church; and, as I had several English friends at

Tours, I awaited the answer to my request to Monseigneur de ----, at

that town. I was ready to accept any invitation; but I received very

few; and was sometimes a little at a loss what to do with my evenings.

The _table d'hte_ was at five o'clock; I did not wish to go to the

expense of a private sitting-room, disliked the dinnery atmosphere of

the _salle  manger_, could not play either at pool or billiards, and

the aspect of my fellow guests was unprepossessing enough to make me

unwilling to enter into any _tte--tte_ gamblings with them. So I

usually rose from table early, and tried to make the most of the

remaining light of the August evenings in walking briskly off to explore

the surrounding country; the middle of the day was too hot for this

purpose, and better employed in lounging on a bench in the Boulevards,

lazily listening to the distant band, and noticing with equal laziness

the faces and figures of the women who passed by.



One Thursday evening, the 18th of August it was, I think, I had gone

further than usual in my walk, and I found that it was later than I

had imagined when I paused to turn back. I fancied I could make a round;

I had enough notion of the direction in which I was, to see that by

turning up a narrow straight lane to my left I should shorten my way

back to Tours. And so I believe I should have done, could I have found

an outlet at the right place, but field-paths are almost unknown in

that part of France, and my lane, stiff and straight as any street, and

marked into terribly vanishing perspective by the regular row of poplars

on each side, seemed interminable. Of course night came on, and I was

in darkness. In England I might have had a chance of seeing a light

in some cottage only a field or two off, and asking my way from the

inhabitants; but here I could see no such welcome sight; indeed, I

believe French peasants go to bed with the summer daylight, so if there

were any habitations in the neighbourhood I never saw them. At last--I

believe I must have walked two hours in the darkness,--I saw the dusky

outline of a wood on one side of the weariful lane, and, impatiently

careless of all forest laws and penalties for trespassers, I made my

way to it, thinking that if the worst came to the worst, I could find

some covert--some shelter where I could lie down and rest, until the

morning light gave me a chance of finding my way back to Tours. But the

plantation, on the outskirts of what appeared to me a dense wood, was of

young trees, too closely planted to be more than slender stems growing

up to a good height, with scanty foliage on their summits. On I went

towards the thicker forest, and once there I slackened my pace, and

began to look about me for a good lair. I was as dainty as Lochiel's

grandchild, who made his grandsire indignant at the luxury of his pillow

of snow: this brake was too full of brambles, that felt damp with dew;

there was no hurry, since I had given up all hope of passing the night

between four walls; and I went leisurely groping about, and trusting

that there were no wolves to be poked up out of their summer drowsiness

by my stick, when all at once I saw a chteau before me, not a quarter

of a mile off, at the end of what seemed to be an ancient avenue (now

overgrown and irregular), which I happened to be crossing, when I looked

to my right, and saw the welcome sight. Large, stately, and dark was

its outline against the dusky night-sky; there were pepper-boxes and

tourelles and what-not fantastically going up into the dim starlight.

And more to the purpose still, though I could not see the details of the

building that I was now facing, it was plain enough that there were

lights in many windows, as if some great entertainment was going on.



""They are hospitable people, at any rate,"" thought I. ""Perhaps they

will give me a bed. I don't suppose French propritaires have traps and

horses quite as plentiful as English gentlemen; but they are evidently

having a large party, and some of their guests may be from Tours, and

will give me a cast back to the Lion d'Or. I am not proud, and I am

dog-tired. I am not above hanging on behind, if need be.""



So, putting a little briskness and spirit into my walk, I went up to

the door, which was standing open, most hospitably, and showing a large

lighted hall, all hung round with spoils of the chase, armour, &c, the

details of which I had not time to notice, for the instant I stood on

the threshold a huge porter appeared, in a strange, old-fashioned dress,

a kind of livery which well befitted the general appearance of the house.

He asked me, in French (so curiously pronounced that I thought I had hit

upon a new kind of _patois_), my name, and whence I came. I thought he

would not be much the wiser, still it was but civil to give it before I

made my request for assistance; so, in reply, I said--



""My name is Whittingham--Richard Whittingham, an English gentleman,

staying at ----."" To my infinite surprise, a light of pleased intelligence

came over the giant's face; he made me a low bow, and said (still in

the same curious dialect) that I was welcome, that I was long expected.



""Long expected!"" What could the fellow mean? Had I stumbled on a nest

of relations by John Calvin's side, who had heard of my genealogical

inquiries, and were gratified and interested by them? But I was too

much pleased to be under shelter for the night to think it necessary to

account for my agreeable reception before I enjoyed it. Just as he was

opening the great heavy _battants_ of the door that led from the hall to

the interior, he turned round and said,--



""Apparently Monsieur le Ganquilleur is not come with you.""



""No! I am all alone; I have lost my way,""--and I was going on with my

explanation, when he, as if quite indifferent to it, led the way up

a great stone staircase, as wide as many rooms, and having on each

landing-place massive iron wickets, in a heavy framework; these the

porter unlocked with the solemn slowness of age. Indeed, a strange,

mysterious awe of the centuries that had passed away since this chteau

was built, came over me as I waited for the turning of the ponderous

keys in the ancient locks. I could almost have fancied that I heard a

mighty rushing murmur (like the ceaseless sound of a distant sea, ebbing

and flowing for ever and for ever), coming forth from the great vacant

galleries that opened out on each side of the broad staircase, and were

to be dimly perceived in the darkness above us. It was as if the voices

of generations of men yet echoed and eddied in the silent air. It was

strange, too, that my friend the porter going before me, ponderously

infirm, with his feeble old hands striving in vain to keep the tall

flambeau he held steadily before him,--strange, I say, that he was the

only domestic I saw in the vast halls and passages, or met with on the

grand staircase. At length we stood before the gilded doors that led

into the saloon where the family--or it might be the company, so great

was the buzz of voices--was assembled. I would have remonstrated when

I found he was going to introduce me, dusty and travel-smeared, in a

morning costume that was not even my best, into this grand _salon_, with

nobody knew how many ladies and gentlemen assembled; but the obstinate

old man was evidently bent upon taking me straight to his master, and

paid no heed to my words.



The doors flew open, and I was ushered into a saloon curiously full of

pale light, which did not culminate on any spot, nor proceed from any

centre, nor flicker with any motion of the air, but filled every nook

and corner, making all things deliciously distinct; different from our

light of gas or candle, as is the difference between a clear southern

atmosphere and that of our misty England.



At the first moment, my arrival excited no attention, the apartment was

so full of people, all intent on their own conversation. But my friend

the porter went up to a handsome lady of middle age, richly attired in

that antique manner which fashion has brought round again of late years,

and, waiting first in an attitude of deep respect till her attention

fell upon him, told her my name and something about me, as far as I

could guess from the gestures of the one and the sudden glance of the

eye of the other.



She immediately came towards me with the most friendly actions of

greeting, even before she had advanced near enough to speak. Then,--and

was it not strange?--her words and accent were that of the commonest

peasant of the country. Yet she herself looked high-bred, and would have

been dignified had she been a shade less restless, had her countenance

worn a little less lively and inquisitive expression. I had been poking

a good deal about the old parts of Tours, and had had to understand the

dialect of the people who dwelt in the March au Vendredi and similar

places, or I really should not have understood my handsome hostess, as

she offered to present me to her husband, a henpecked, gentlemanly man,

who was more quaintly attired than she in the very extreme of that style

of dress. I thought to myself that in France, as in England, it is the

provincials who carry fashion to such an excess as to become ridiculous.



However, he spoke (still in the _patois_) of his pleasure in making my

acquaintance, and led me to a strange uneasy easy-chair, much of a piece

with the rest of the furniture, which might have taken its place without

any anachronism by the side of that in the Htel Cluny. Then again

began the clatter of French voices, which my arrival had for an instant

interrupted, and I had leisure to look about me. Opposite to me sat a

very sweet-looking lady, who must have been a great beauty in her youth,

I should think, and would be charming in old age, from the sweetness of

her countenance. She was, however, extremely fat, and on seeing her feet

laid up before her on a cushion, I at once perceived that they were so

swollen as to render her incapable of walking, which probably brought on

her excessive _embonpoint_. Her hands were plump and small, but rather

coarse-grained in texture, not quite so clean as they might have been,

and altogether not so aristocratic-looking as the charming face. Her

dress was of superb black velvet, ermine-trimmed, with diamonds thrown

all abroad over it.



Not far from her stood the least little man I had ever seen; of such

admirable proportions no one could call him a dwarf, because with

that word we usually associate something of deformity; but yet with an

elfin look of shrewd, hard, worldly wisdom in his face that marred the

impression which his delicate regular little features would otherwise

have conveyed. Indeed, I do not think he was quite of equal rank with

the rest of the company, for his dress was inappropriate to the occasion

(and he apparently was an invited, while I was an involuntary guest);

and one or two of his gestures and actions were more like the tricks of

an uneducated rustic than anything else. To explain what I mean: his

boots had evidently seen much service, and had been re-topped, re-heeled,

re-soled to the extent of cobbler's powers. Why should he have come in

them if they were not his best--his only pair? And what can be more

ungenteel than poverty? Then again he had an uneasy trick of putting his

hand up to his throat, as if he expected to find something the matter

with it; and he had the awkward habit--which I do not think he could

have copied from Dr. Johnson, because most probably he had never heard

of him--of trying always to retrace his steps on the exact boards on

which he had trodden to arrive at any particular part of the room.

Besides, to settle the question, I once heard him addressed as Monsieur

Poucet, without any aristocratic ""de"" for a prefix; and nearly every one

else in the room was a marquis, at any rate.



I say, ""nearly every one;"" for some strange people had the entre;

unless, indeed, they were, like me, benighted. One of the guests I

should have taken for a servant, but for the extraordinary influence he

seemed to have over the man I took for his master, and who never did

anything without, apparently, being urged thereto by this follower. The

master, magnificently dressed, but ill at ease in his clothes, as if

they had been made for some one else, was a weak-looking, handsome

man, continually sauntering about, and I almost guessed an object of

suspicion to some of the gentlemen present, which, perhaps, drove him on

the companionship of his follower, who was dressed something in the

style of an ambassador's chasseur; yet it was not a chasseur's dress

after all; it was something more thoroughly old-world; boots half way up

his ridiculously small legs, which clattered as he walked along, as if

they were too large for his little feet; and a great quantity of grey

fur, as trimming to coat, court-mantle, boots, cap--everything. You know

the way in which certain countenances remind you perpetually of some

animal, be it bird or beast! Well, this chasseur (as I will call him

for want of a better name) was exceedingly like the great Tom-cat that

you have seen so often in my chambers, and laughed at almost as often

for his uncanny gravity of demeanour. Grey whiskers has my Tom--grey

whiskers had the chasseur: grey hair overshadows the upper lip of my

Tom--grey mustachios hid that of the chasseur. The pupils of Tom's eyes

dilate and contract as I had thought cats' pupils only could do, until

I saw those of the chasseur. To be sure, canny as Tom is, the chasseur

had the advantage in the more intelligent expression. He seemed to have

obtained most complete sway over his master or patron, whose looks he

watched, and whose steps he followed, with a kind of distrustful

interest that puzzled me greatly.



There were several other groups in the more distant part of the saloon,

all of the stately old school, all grand and noble, I conjectured from

their bearing. They seemed perfectly well acquainted with each other,

as if they were in the habit of meeting. But I was interrupted in my

observations by the tiny little gentleman on the opposite side of the

room coming across to take a place beside me. It is no difficult matter

to a Frenchman to slide into conversation, and so gracefully did my

pigmy friend keep up the character of the nation, that we were almost

confidential before ten minutes had elapsed.



Now I was quite aware that the welcome which all had extended to me,

from the porter up to the vivacious lady and meek lord of the castle,

was intended for some other person. But it required either a degree

of moral courage, of which I cannot boast, or the self-reliance and

conversational powers of a bolder and cleverer man than I, to undeceive

people who had fallen into so fortunate a mistake for me. Yet the little

man by my side insinuated himself so much into my confidence, that I had

half a mind to tell him of my exact situation, and to turn him into a

friend and an ally.



""Madame is perceptibly growing older,"" said he, in the midst of my

perplexity, glancing at our hostess.



""Madame is still a very fine woman,"" replied I.



""Now, is it not strange,"" continued he, lowering his voice, ""how women

almost invariably praise the absent, or departed, as if they were angels

of light, while as for the present, or the living""--here he shrugged up

his little shoulders, and made an expressive pause. ""Would you believe

it! Madame is always praising her late husband to monsieur's face; till,

in fact, we guests are quite perplexed how to look: for, you know, the

late M. de Retz's character was quite notorious,--everybody has heard of

him."" All the world of Touraine, thought I, but I made an assenting

noise.



At this instant, monsieur our host came up to me, and with a civil look

of tender interest (such as some people put on when they inquire after

your mother, about whom they do not care one straw), asked if I had

heard lately how my cat was? ""How my cat was!"" What could the man mean?

My cat! Could he mean the tailless Tom, born in the Isle of Man, and now

supposed to be keeping guard against the incursions of rats and mice

into my chambers in London? Tom is, as you know, on pretty good terms

with some of my friends, using their legs for rubbing-posts without

scruple, and highly esteemed by them for his gravity of demeanour, and

wise manner of winking his eyes. But could his fame have reached across

the Channel? However, an answer must be returned to the inquiry, as

monsieur's face was bent down to mine with a look of polite anxiety; so

I, in my turn, assumed an expression of gratitude, and assured him that,

to the best of my belief, my cat was in remarkably good health.



""And the climate agrees with her?""



""Perfectly,"" said I, in a maze of wonder at this deep solicitude in a

tailless cat who had lost one foot and half an ear in some cruel trap.

My host smiled a sweet smile, and, addressing a few words to my little

neighbour, passed on.



""How wearisome those aristocrats are!"" quoth my neighbour, with a slight

sneer. ""Monsieur's conversation rarely extends to more than two sentences

to any one. By that time his faculties are exhausted, and he needs the

refreshment of silence. You and I, monsieur, are, at any rate, indebted

to our own wits for our rise in the world!""



Here again I was bewildered! As you know, I am rather proud of my

descent from families which, if not noble themselves, are allied to

nobility,--and as to my ""rise in the world""--if I had risen, it would

have been rather for balloon-like qualities than for mother-wit, to

being unencumbered with heavy ballast either in my head or my pockets.

However, it was my cue to agree: so I smiled again.



""For my part,"" said he, ""if a man does not stick at trifles, if he knows

how to judiciously add to, or withhold facts, and is not sentimental in

his parade of humanity, he is sure to do well; sure to affix a _de_ or

_von_ to his name, and end his days in comfort. There is an example of

what I am saying""--and he glanced furtively at the weak-looking master

of the sharp, intelligent servant, whom I have called the chasseur.



""Monsieur le Marquis would never have been anything but a miller's son,

if it had not been for the talents of his servant. Of course you know

his antecedents?""



I was going to make some remarks on the changes in the order of the

peerage since the days of Louis XVI.--going, in fact, to be very

sensible and historical--when there was a slight commotion among

the people at the other end of the room. Lacqueys in quaint liveries

must have come in from behind the tapestry, I suppose (for I never

saw them enter, though I sate right opposite to the doors), and were

handing about the slight beverages and slighter viands which are

considered sufficient refreshments, but which looked rather meagre to

my hungry appetite. These footmen were standing solemnly opposite

to a lady,--beautiful, splendid as the dawn, but--sound asleep in a

magnificent settee. A gentleman who showed so much irritation at her

ill-timed slumbers, that I think he must have been her husband, was

trying to awaken her with actions not far removed from shakings. All in

vain; she was quite unconscious of his annoyance, or the smiles of the

company, or the automatic solemnity of the waiting footman, or the

perplexed anxiety of monsieur and madame.



My little friend sat down with a sneer, as if his curiosity was quenched

in contempt.



""Moralists would make an infinity of wise remarks on that scene,"" said

he. ""In the first place, note the ridiculous position into which their

superstitious reverence for rank and title puts all these people. Because

monsieur is a reigning prince over some minute principality, the exact

situation of which no one has as yet discovered, no one must venture to

take their glass of eau sucr till Madame la Princesse awakens; and,

judging from past experience, those poor lacqueys may have to stand for

a century before that happens. Next--always speaking as a moralist, you

will observe--note how difficult it is to break off bad habits acquired

in youth!""



Just then the prince succeeded, by what means I did not see, in awaking

the beautiful sleeper. But at first she did not remember where she was,

and looking up at her husband with loving eyes, she smiled and said:



""Is it you, my prince?""



But he was too conscious of the suppressed amusement of the spectators

and his own consequent annoyance, to be reciprocally tender, and turned

away with some little French expression, best rendered into English by

""Pooh, pooh, my dear!""



After I had had a glass of delicious wine of some unknown quality, my

courage was in rather better plight than before, and I told my cynical

little neighbour--whom I must say I was beginning to dislike--that I had

lost my way in the wood, and had arrived at the chteau quite by

mistake.



He seemed mightily amused at my story; said that the same thing had

happened to himself more than once; and told me that I had better luck

than he had on one of these occasions, when, from his account, he must

have been in considerable danger of his life. He ended his story by

making me admire his boots, which he said he still wore, patched though

they were, and all their excellent quality lost by patching, because

they were of such a first-rate make for long pedestrian excursions.

""Though, indeed,"" he wound up by saying, ""the new fashion of railroads

would seem to supersede the necessity for this description of boots.""



When I consulted him as to whether I ought to make myself known to my

host and hostess as a benighted traveller, instead of the guest whom

they had taken me for, he exclaimed, ""By no means! I hate such squeamish

morality."" And he seemed much offended by my innocent question, as if it

seemed by implication to condemn something in himself. He was offended

and silent; and just at this moment I caught the sweet, attractive eyes

of the lady opposite--that lady whom I named at first as being no longer

in the bloom of youth, but as being somewhat infirm about the feet, which

were supported on a raised cushion before her. Her looks seemed to say,

""Come here, and let us have some conversation together;"" and, with a bow

of silent excuse to my little companion, I went across to the lame old

lady. She acknowledged my coming with the prettiest gesture of thanks

possible; and, half apologetically, said, ""It is a little dull to be

unable to move about on such evenings as this; but it is a just punishment

to me for my early vanities. My poor feet, that were by nature so small,

are now taking their revenge for my cruelty in forcing them into such

little slippers.... Besides, monsieur,"" with a pleasant smile, ""I thought

it was possible you might be weary of the malicious sayings of your

little neighbour. He has not borne the best character in his youth, and

such men are sure to be cynical in their old age.""



""Who is he?"" asked I, with English abruptness.



""His name is Poucet, and his father was, I believe, a wood-cutter, or

charcoal burner, or something of the sort. They do tell sad stories

of connivance at murder, ingratitude, and obtaining money on false

pretences--but you will think me as bad as he if I go on with my

slanders. Rather let us admire the lovely lady coming up towards us,

with the roses in her hand--I never see her without roses, they are so

closely connected with her past history, as you are doubtless aware. Ah,

beauty!"" said my companion to the lady drawing near to us, ""it is like

you to come to me, now that I can no longer go to you."" Then turning to

me, and gracefully drawing me into the conversation, she said, ""You must

know that, although we never met until we were both married, we have

been almost like sisters ever since. There have been so many points

of resemblance in our circumstances, and I think I may say in our

characters. We had each two elder sisters--mine were but half-sisters,

though--who were not so kind to us as they might have been.""



""But have been sorry for it since,"" put in the other lady.



""Since we have married princes,"" continued the same lady, with an arch

smile that had nothing of unkindness in it, ""for we both have married

far above our original stations in life; we are both unpunctual in our

habits, and, in consequence of this failing of ours, we have both had to

suffer mortification and pain.""



""And both are charming,"" said a whisper close behind me. ""My lord the

marquis, say it--say, 'And both are charming.'""



""And both are charming,"" was spoken aloud by another voice. I turned,

and saw the wily cat-like chasseur, prompting his master to make civil

speeches.



The ladies bowed with that kind of haughty acknowledgment which shows

that compliments from such a source are distasteful. But our trio of

conversation was broken up, and I was sorry for it. The marquis looked

as if he had been stirred up to make that one speech, and hoped that he

would not be expected to say more; while behind him stood the chasseur,

half impertinent and half servile in his ways and attitudes. The ladies,

who were real ladies, seemed to be sorry for the awkwardness of the

marquis, and addressed some trifling questions to him, adapting

themselves to the subjects on which he could have no trouble in answering.

The chasseur, meanwhile, was talking to himself in a growling tone of

voice. I had fallen a little into the background at this interruption in

a conversation which promised to be so pleasant, and I could not help

hearing his words.



""Really, De Carabas grows more stupid every day. I have a great mind to

throw off his boots, and leave him to his fate. I was intended for a

court, and to a court I will go, and make my own fortune as I have made

his. The emperor will appreciate my talents.""



And such are the habits of the French, or such his forgetfulness of good

manners in his anger, that he spat right and left on the parquetted

floor.



Just then a very ugly, very pleasant-looking man, came towards the

two ladies to whom I had lately been speaking, leading up to them a

delicate, fair woman, dressed all in the softest white, as if she were

_voue au blanc_. I do not think there was a bit of colour about her.

I thought I heard her making, as she came along, a little noise of

pleasure, not exactly like the singing of a tea-kettle, nor yet like the

cooing of a dove, but reminding me of each sound.



""Madame de Mioumiou was anxious to see you,"" said he, addressing the

lady with the roses, ""so I have brought her across to give you a

pleasure!"" What an honest, good face! but oh! how ugly! And yet I liked

his ugliness better than most persons' beauty. There was a look of

pathetic acknowledgment of his ugliness, and a deprecation of your too

hasty judgment, in his countenance that was positively winning. The

soft, white lady kept glancing at my neighbour the chasseur, as if they

had had some former acquaintance, which puzzled me very much, as they

were of such different rank. However, their nerves were evidently strung

to the same tune, for at a sound behind the tapestry, which was more

like the scuttering of rats and mice than anything else, both Madame de

Mioumiou and the chasseur started with the most eager look of anxiety on

their countenances, and by their restless movements--madame's panting,

and the fiery dilation of his eyes--one might see that commonplace

sounds affected them both in a manner very different to the rest of the

company. The ugly husband of the lovely lady with the roses now

addressed himself to me.



""We are much disappointed,"" he said, ""in finding that monsieur is not

accompanied by his countryman--le grand Jean d'Angleterre; I cannot

pronounce his name rightly""--and he looked at me to help him out.



""Le grand Jean d'Angleterre!"" now who was le grand Jean d'Angleterre?

John Bull? John Russell? John Bright?



""Jean--Jean""--continued the gentleman, seeing my embarrassment. ""Ah,

these terrible English names--'Jean de Ganquilleur!'""



I was as wise as ever. And yet the name struck me as familiar, but

slightly disguised. I repeated it to myself. It was mighty like John the

Giant-killer, only his friends always call that worthy ""Jack."" I said

the name aloud.



""Ah, that is it!"" said he. ""But why has he not accompanied you to our

little reunion to-night?""



I had been rather puzzled once or twice before, but this serious question

added considerably to my perplexity. Jack the Giant-killer had once, it

is true, been rather an intimate friend of mine, as far as (printer's)

ink and paper can keep up a friendship, but I had not heard his name

mentioned for years; and for aught I knew he lay enchanted with King

Arthur's knights, who lie entranced until the blast of the trumpets of

four mighty kings shall call them to help at England's need. But the

question had been asked in serious earnest by that gentleman, whom I

more wished to think well of me than I did any other person in the room.

So I answered respectfully that it was long since I had heard anything

of my countryman; but that I was sure it would have given him as much

pleasure as it was doing myself to have been present at such an agreeable

gathering of friends. He bowed, and then the lame lady took up the word.



""To-night is the night when, of all the year, this great old forest

surrounding the castle is said to be haunted by the phantom of a little

peasant girl who once lived hereabouts; the tradition is that she was

devoured by a wolf. In former days I have seen her on this night out

of yonder window at the end of the gallery. Will you, ma belle, take

monsieur to see the view outside by the moonlight (you may possibly see

the phantom-child); and leave me to a little _tte--tte_ with your

husband?""



With a gentle movement the lady with the roses complied with the other's

request, and we went to a great window, looking down on the forest, in

which I had lost my way. The tops of the far-spreading and leafy trees

lay motionless beneath us in that pale, wan light, which shows objects

almost as distinct in form, though not in colour, as by day. We looked

down on the countless avenues, which seemed to converge from all quarters

to the great old castle; and suddenly across one, quite near to us,

there passed the figure of a little girl, with the ""capuchon"" on, that

takes the place of a peasant girl's bonnet in France. She had a basket

on one arm, and by her, on the side to which her head was turned, there

went a wolf. I could almost have said it was licking her hand, as if in

penitent love, if either penitence or love had ever been a quality of

wolves,--but though not of living, perhaps it may be of phantom wolves.



""There, we have seen her!"" exclaimed my beautiful companion. ""Though so

long dead, her simple story of household goodness and trustful simplicity

still lingers in the hearts of all who have ever heard of her; and the

country-people about here say that seeing that phantom-child on this

anniversary brings good luck for the year. Let us hope that we shall

share in the traditionary good fortune. Ah! here is Madame de Retz--she

retains the name of her first husband, you know, as he was of higher

rank than the present."" We were joined by our hostess.



""If monsieur is fond of the beauties of nature and art,"" said she,

perceiving that I had been looking at the view from the great window,

""he will perhaps take pleasure in seeing the picture."" Here she sighed,

with a little affectation of grief. ""You know the picture I allude to,""

addressing my companion, who bowed assent, and smiled a little

maliciously, as I followed the lead of madame.



I went after her to the other end of the saloon, noting by the way with

what keen curiosity she caught up what was passing either in word or

action on each side of her. When we stood opposite to the end wall, I

perceived a full-length picture of a handsome, peculiar-looking man,

with--in spite of his good looks--a very fierce and scowling expression.

My hostess clasped her hands together as her arms hung down in front,

and sighed once more. Then, half in soliloquy, she said--



""He was the love of my youth; his stern yet manly character first

touched this heart of mine. When--when shall I cease to deplore his

loss!""



Not being acquainted with her enough to answer this question (if,

indeed, it were not sufficiently answered by the fact of her second

marriage), I felt awkward; and, by way of saying something, I

remarked,--



""The countenance strikes me as resembling something I have seen

before--in an engraving from an historical picture, I think; only, it is

there the principal figure in a group: he is holding a lady by her hair,

and threatening her with his scimitar, while two cavaliers are rushing

up the stairs, apparently only just in time to save her life.""



""Alas, alas!"" said she, ""you too accurately describe a miserable passage

in my life, which has often been represented in a false light. The best

of husbands""--here she sobbed, and became slightly inarticulate with her

grief--""will sometimes be displeased. I was young and curious, he was

justly angry with my disobedience--my brothers were too hasty--the

consequence is, I became a widow!""



After due respect for her tears, I ventured to suggest some commonplace

consolation. She turned round sharply:--



""No, monsieur: my only comfort is that I have never forgiven the brothers

who interfered so cruelly, in such an uncalled-for manner, between my

dear husband and myself. To quote my friend Monsieur Sganarelle--'Ce

sont petites choses qui sont de temps en temps necessaires dans l'amiti;

et cinq ou six coups d'pe entre gens qui s'aiment ne font que

ragaillardir l'affection.' You observe the colouring is not quite what

it should be?""



""In this light the beard is of rather a peculiar tint,"" said I.



""Yes: the painter did not do it justice. It was most lovely, and gave

him such a distinguished air, quite different from the common herd.

Stay, I will show you the exact colour, if you will come near this

flambeau!"" And going near the light, she took off a bracelet of hair,

with a magnificent clasp of pearls. It was peculiar, certainly. I did

not know what to say. ""His precious lovely beard!"" said she. ""And the

pearls go so well with the delicate blue!""



Her husband, who had come up to us, and waited till her eye fell upon

him before venturing to speak, now said, ""It is strange Monsieur Ogre is

not yet arrived!""



""Not at all strange,"" said she, tartly. ""He was always very stupid, and

constantly falls into mistakes, in which he comes worse off; and it is

very well he does, for he is a credulous and cowardly fellow. Not at all

strange! If you will""--turning to her husband, so that I hardly heard

her words, until I caught--""Then everybody would have their rights, and

we should have no more trouble. Is it not, monsieur?"" addressing me.



""If I were in England, I should imagine madame was speaking of the

reform bill, or the millennium,--but I am in ignorance.""



And just as I spoke, the great folding-doors were thrown open wide, and

every one started to their feet to greet a little old lady, leaning on a

thin black wand--and--



""Madame la Femarraine,"" was announced by a chorus of sweet shrill

voices.



And in a moment I was lying in the grass close by a hollow oak-tree,

with the slanting glory of the dawning day shining full in my face, and

thousands of little birds and delicate insects piping and warbling out

their welcome to the ruddy splendour.









SIX WEEKS AT HEPPENHEIM.





After I left Oxford, I determined to spend some months in travel before

settling down in life. My father had left me a few thousands, the income

arising from which would be enough to provide for all the necessary

requirements of a lawyer's education; such as lodgings in a quiet part

of London, fees and payment to the distinguished barrister with whom I

was to read; but there would be small surplus left over for luxuries or

amusements; and as I was rather in debt on leaving college, since I had

forestalled my income, and the expenses of my travelling would have to

be defrayed out of my capital, I determined that they should not exceed

fifty pounds. As long as that sum would last me I would remain abroad;

when it was spent my holiday should be over, and I would return and

settle down somewhere in the neighbourhood of Russell Square, in order

to be near Mr. ----'s chambers in Lincoln's-inn. I had to wait in London

for one day while my passport was being made out, and I went to examine

the streets in which I purposed to live; I had picked them out, from

studying a map, as desirable; and so they were, if judged entirely by

my reason; but their aspect was very depressing to one country-bred, and

just fresh from the beautiful street-architecture of Oxford. The thought

of living in such a monotonous gray district for years made me all the

more anxious to prolong my holiday by all the economy which could eke

out my fifty pounds. I thought I could make it last for one hundred days

at least. I was a good walker, and had no very luxurious tastes in the

matter of accommodation or food; I had as fair a knowledge of German and

French as any untravelled Englishman can have; and I resolved to avoid

expensive hotels such as my own countrymen frequented.



I have stated this much about myself to explain how I fell in with the

little story that I am going to record, but with which I had not much

to do,--my part in it being little more than that of a sympathizing

spectator. I had been through France into Switzerland, where I had gone

beyond my strength in the way of walking, and I was on my way home, when

one evening I came to the village of Heppenheim, on the Berg-Strasse. I

had strolled about the dirty town of Worms all morning, and dined in a

filthy hotel; and after that I had crossed the Rhine, and walked through

Lorsch to Heppenheim. I was unnaturally tired and languid as I dragged

myself up the rough-paved and irregular village street to the inn

recommended to me. It was a large building, with a green court before

it. A cross-looking but scrupulously clean hostess received me, and

showed me into a large room with a dinner-table in it, which, though it

might have accommodated thirty or forty guests, only stretched down half

the length of the eating-room. There were windows at each end of the

room; two looked to the front of the house, on which the evening shadows

had already fallen; the opposite two were partly doors, opening into a

large garden full of trained fruit-trees and beds of vegetables, amongst

which rose-bushes and other flowers seemed to grow by permission, not by

original intention. There was a stove at each end of the room, which, I

suspect, had originally been divided into two. The door by which I had

entered was exactly in the middle, and opposite to it was another,

leading to a great bed-chamber, which my hostess showed me as my

sleeping quarters for the night.



If the place had been much less clean and inviting, I should have

remained there; I was almost surprised myself at my vis inerti; once

seated in the last warm rays of the slanting sun by the garden window,

I was disinclined to move, or even to speak. My hostess had taken my

orders as to my evening meal, and had left me. The sun went down, and I

grew shivery. The vast room looked cold and bare; the darkness brought

out shadows that perplexed me, because I could not fully make out the

objects that produced them after dazzling my eyes by gazing out into the

crimson light.



Some one came in; it was the maiden to prepare for my supper. She began

to lay the cloth at one end of the large table. There was a smaller one

close by me. I mustered up my voice, which seemed a little as if it was

getting beyond my control, and called to her,--



""Will you let me have my supper here on this table?""



She came near; the light fell on her while I was in shadow. She was a

tall young woman, with a fine strong figure, a pleasant face, expressive

of goodness and sense, and with a good deal of comeliness about it, too,

although the fair complexion was bronzed and reddened by weather, so as

to have lost much of its delicacy, and the features, as I had afterwards

opportunity enough of observing, were anything but regular. She had white

teeth, however, and well-opened blue eyes--grave-looking eyes which had

shed tears for past sorrow--plenty of light-brown hair, rather elaborately

plaited, and fastened up by two great silver pins. That was all--perhaps

more than all--I noticed that first night. She began to lay the cloth

where I had directed. A shiver passed over me: she looked at me, and

then said,--



""The gentleman is cold: shall I light the stove?""



Something vexed me--I am not usually so impatient: it was the coming-on

of serious illness--I did not like to be noticed so closely; I believed

that food would restore me, and I did not want to have my meal delayed,

as I feared it might be by the lighting of the stove; and most of all I

was feverishly annoyed by movement. I answered sharply and abruptly,--



""No; bring supper quickly; that is all I want.""



Her quiet, sad eyes met mine for a moment; but I saw no change in their

expression, as if I had vexed her by my rudeness: her countenance did

not for an instant lose its look of patient sense, and that is pretty

nearly all I can remember of Thekla that first evening at Heppenheim.



I suppose I ate my supper, or tried to do so, at any rate; and I must

have gone to bed, for days after I became conscious of lying there,

weak as a new-born babe, and with a sense of past pain in all my weary

limbs. As is the case in recovering from fever, one does not care to

connect facts, much less to reason upon them; so how I came to be lying

in that strange bed, in that large, half-furnished room; in what house

that room was; in what town, in what country, I did not take the trouble

to recal. It was of much more consequence to me then to discover what

was the well-known herb that gave the scent to the clean, coarse sheets

in which I lay. Gradually I extended my observations, always confining

myself to the present. I must have been well cared-for by some one, and

that lately, too, for the window was shaded, so as to prevent the

morning sun from coming in upon the bed; there was the crackling of

fresh wood in the great white china stove, which must have been newly

replenished within a short time.



By-and-by the door opened slowly. I cannot tell why, but my impulse was

to shut my eyes as if I were still asleep. But I could see through my

apparently closed eyelids. In came, walking on tip-toe, with a slow care

that defeated its object, two men. The first was aged from thirty to

forty, in the dress of a Black Forest peasant,--old-fashioned coat and

knee-breeches of strong blue cloth, but of a thoroughly good quality; he

was followed by an older man, whose dress, of more pretension as to cut

and colour (it was all black), was, nevertheless, as I had often the

opportunity of observing afterwards, worn threadbare.



Their first sentences, in whispered German, told me who they were: the

landlord of the inn where I was lying a helpless log, and the village

doctor who had been called in. The latter felt my pulse, and nodded his

head repeatedly in approbation. I had instinctively known that I was

getting better, and hardly cared for this confirmation; but it seemed

to give the truest pleasure to the landlord, who shook the hand of the

doctor, in a pantomime expressive of as much thankfulness as if I had

been his brother. Some low-spoken remarks were made, and then some

question was asked, to which, apparently, my host was unable to reply.

He left the room, and in a minute or two returned, followed by Thekla,

who was questioned by the doctor, and replied with a quiet clearness,

showing how carefully the details of my illness had been observed by

her. Then she left the room, and, as if every minute had served to

restore to my brain its power of combining facts, I was suddenly prompted

to open my eyes, and ask in the best German I could muster what day of

the month it was; not that I clearly remembered the date of my arrival

at Heppenheim, but I knew it was about the beginning of September.



Again the doctor conveyed his sense of extreme satisfaction in a series

of rapid pantomimic nods, and then replied in deliberate but tolerable

English, to my great surprise,--



""It is the 29th of September, my dear sir. You must thank the dear God.

Your fever has made its course of twenty-one days. Now patience and care

must be practised. The good host and his household will have the care;

you must have the patience. If you have relations in England, I will do

my endeavours to tell them the state of your health.""



""I have no near relations,"" said I, beginning in my weakness to cry, as

I remembered, as if it had been a dream, the days when I had father,

mother, sister.



""Chut, chut!"" said he; then, turning to the landlord, he told him in

German to make Thekla bring me one of her good bouillons; after which

I was to have certain medicines, and to sleep as undisturbedly as

possible. For days, he went on, I should require constant watching and

careful feeding; every twenty minutes I was to have something, either

wine or soup, in small quantities.



A dim notion came into my hazy mind that my previous husbandry of my

fifty pounds, by taking long walks and scanty diet, would prove in the

end very bad economy; but I sank into dozing unconsciousness before I

could quite follow out my idea. I was roused by the touch of a spoon on

my lips; it was Thekla feeding me. Her sweet, grave face had something

approaching to a mother's look of tenderness upon it, as she gave me

spoonful after spoonful with gentle patience and dainty care: and then I

fell asleep once more. When next I wakened it was night; the stove was

lighted, and the burning wood made a pleasant crackle, though I could

only see the outlines and edges of red flame through the crevices of

the small iron door. The uncurtained window on my left looked into the

purple, solemn night. Turning a little, I saw Thekla sitting near a table,

sewing diligently at some great white piece of household work. Every now

and then she stopped to snuff the candle; sometimes she began to ply her

needle again immediately; but once or twice she let her busy hands lie

idly in her lap, and looked into the darkness, and thought deeply for a

moment or two; these pauses always ended in a kind of sobbing sigh, the

sound of which seemed to restore her to self-consciousness, and she took

to her sewing even more diligently than before. Watching her had a sort

of dreamy interest for me; this diligence of hers was a pleasant contrast

to my repose; it seemed to enhance the flavour of my rest. I was too

much of an animal just then to have my sympathy, or even my curiosity,

strongly excited by her look of sad remembrance, or by her sighs.



After a while she gave a little start, looked at a watch lying by her

on the table, and came, shading the candle by her hand, softly to my

bedside. When she saw my open eyes she went to a porringer placed at the

top of the stove, and fed me with soup. She did not speak while doing

this. I was half aware that she had done it many times since the doctor's

visit, although this seemed to be the first time that I was fully awake.

She passed her arm under the pillow on which my head rested, and raised

me a very little; her support was as firm as a man's could have been.

Again back to her work, and I to my slumbers, without a word being

exchanged.



It was broad daylight when I wakened again; I could see the sunny

atmosphere of the garden outside stealing in through the nicks at the

side of the shawl hung up to darken the room--a shawl which I was sure

had not been there when I had observed the window in the night. How

gently my nurse must have moved about while doing her thoughtful act!



My breakfast was brought me by the hostess; she who had received me on

my first arrival at this hospitable inn. She meant to do everything

kindly, I am sure; but a sick room was not her place; by a thousand

little mal-adroitnesses she fidgeted me past bearing; her shoes

creaked, her dress rustled; she asked me questions about myself which

it irritated me to answer; she congratulated me on being so much better,

while I was faint for want of the food which she delayed giving me in

order to talk. My host had more sense in him when he came in, although

his shoes creaked as well as hers. By this time I was somewhat revived,

and could talk a little; besides, it seemed churlish to be longer

without acknowledging so much kindness received.



""I am afraid I have been a great trouble,"" said I. ""I can only say that

I am truly grateful.""



His good broad face reddened, and he moved a little uneasily.



""I don't see how I could have done otherwise than I----than we, did,""

replied he, in the soft German of the district. ""We were all glad enough

to do what we could; I don't say it was a pleasure, because it is our

busiest time of year,--but then,"" said he, laughing a little awkwardly,

as if he feared his expression might have been misunderstood, ""I don't

suppose it has been a pleasure to you either, sir, to be laid up so far

from home.""



""No, indeed.""



""I may as well tell you now, sir, that we had to look over your papers

and clothes. In the first place, when you were so ill I would fain have

let your kinsfolk know, if I could have found a clue; and besides, you

needed linen.""



""I am wearing a shirt of yours though,"" said I, touching my sleeve.



""Yes, sir!"" said he again, reddening a little. ""I told Thekla to take

the finest out of the chest; but I am afraid you find it coarser than

your own.""



For all answer I could only lay my weak hand on the great brown paw

resting on the bed-side. He gave me a sudden squeeze in return that I

thought would have crushed my bones.



""I beg your pardon, sir,"" said he, misinterpreting the sudden look of

pain which I could not repress; ""but watching a man come out of the

shadow of death into life makes one feel very friendly towards him.""



""No old or true friend that I have had could have done more for me than

you, and your wife, and Thekla, and the good doctor.""



""I am a widower,"" said he, turning round the great wedding-ring that

decked his third finger. ""My sister keeps house for me, and takes care

of the children,--that is to say, she does it with the help of Thekla,

the house-maiden. But I have other servants,"" he continued. ""I am well

to do, the good God be thanked! I have land, and cattle, and vineyards.

It will soon be our vintage-time, and then you must go and see my

grapes as they come into the village. I have a '_chasse_,' too, in the

Odenwald; perhaps one day you will be strong enough to go and shoot the

'_chevreuil_' with me.""



His good, true heart was trying to make me feel like a welcome guest.

Some time afterwards I learnt from the doctor that--my poor fifty pounds

being nearly all expended--my host and he had been brought to believe in

my poverty, as the necessary examination of my clothes and papers showed

so little evidence of wealth. But I myself have but little to do with

my story; I only name these things, and repeat these conversations, to

show what a true, kind, honest man my host was. By the way, I may as

well call him by his name henceforward, Fritz Mller. The doctor's name,

Wiedermann.



I was tired enough with this interview with Fritz Mller; but when Dr.

Wiedermann came he pronounced me to be much better; and through the

day much the same course was pursued as on the previous one: being

fed, lying still, and sleeping, were my passive and active occupations.

It was a hot, sunshiny day, and I craved for air. Fresh air does not

enter into the pharmacopoeia of a German doctor; but somehow I obtained

my wish. During the morning hours the window through which the sun

streamed--the window looking on to the front court--was opened a little;

and through it I heard the sounds of active life, which gave me pleasure

and interest enough. The hen's cackle, the cock's exultant call when he

had found the treasure of a grain of corn,--the movements of a tethered

donkey, and the cooing and whirring of the pigeons which lighted on the

window-sill, gave me just subjects enough for interest. Now and then

a cart or carriage drove up,--I could hear them ascending the rough

village street long before they stopped at the ""Halbmond,"" the village

inn. Then there came a sound of running and haste in the house; and

Thekla was always called for in sharp, imperative tones. I heard little

children's footsteps, too, from time to time; and once there must have

been some childish accident or hurt, for a shrill, plaintive little

voice kept calling out, ""Thekla, Thekla, liebe Thekla."" Yet, after the

first early morning hours, when my hostess attended on my wants, it was

always Thekla who came to give me my food or my medicine; who redded

up my room; who arranged the degree of light, shifting the temporary

curtain with the shifting sun; and always as quietly and deliberately

as though her attendance upon me were her sole work. Once or twice my

hostess came into the large eating-room (out of which my room opened),

and called Thekla away from whatever was her occupation in my room at

the time, in a sharp, injured, imperative whisper. Once I remember it

was to say that sheets were wanted for some stranger's bed, and to

ask where she, the speaker, could have put the keys, in a tone of

irritation, as though Thekla were responsible for Frulein Mller's

own forgetfulness.



Night came on; the sounds of daily life died away into silence; the

children's voices were no more heard; the poultry were all gone to

roost; the beasts of burden to their stables; and travellers were

housed. Then Thekla came in softly and quietly, and took up her

appointed place, after she had done all in her power for my comfort.

I felt that I was in no state to be left all those weary hours which

intervened between sunset and sunrise; but I did feel ashamed that this

young woman, who had watched by me all the previous night, and for aught

I knew, for many before, and had worked hard, been run off her legs, as

English servants would say, all day long, should come and take up her

care of me again; and it was with a feeling of relief that I saw her

head bend forwards, and finally rest on her arms, which had fallen on

the white piece of sewing spread before her on the table. She slept; and

I slept. When I wakened dawn was stealing into the room, and making pale

the lamplight. Thekla was standing by the stove, where she had been

preparing the bouillon I should require on wakening. But she did not

notice my half-open eyes, although her face was turned towards the bed.

She was reading a letter slowly, as if its words were familiar to her,

yet as though she were trying afresh to extract some fuller or some

different meaning from their construction. She folded it up softly and

slowly, and replaced it in her pocket with the quiet movement habitual

to her. Then she looked before her, not at me, but at vacancy filled up

by memories; and as the enchanter brought up the scenes and people

which she saw, but I could not, her eyes filled with tears--tears that

gathered almost imperceptibly to herself as it would seem--for when one

large drop fell on her hands (held slightly together before her as she

stood) she started a little, and brushed her eyes with the back of her

hand, and then came towards the bed to see if I was awake. If I had not

witnessed her previous emotion, I could never have guessed that she had

any hidden sorrow or pain from her manner; tranquil, self-restrained as

usual. The thought of this letter haunted me, especially as more than

once I, wakeful or watchful during the ensuing nights, either saw it in

her hands, or suspected that she had been recurring to it from noticing

the same sorrowful, dreamy look upon her face when she thought herself

unobserved. Most likely every one has noticed how inconsistently out of

proportion some ideas become when one is shut up in any place without

change of scene or thought. I really grew quite irritated about this

letter. If I did not see it, I suspected it lay _perdu_ in her pocket.

What was in it? Of course it was a love-letter; but if so, what was

going wrong in the course of her love? I became like a spoilt child in

my recovery; every one whom I saw for the time being was thinking only of

me, so it was perhaps no wonder that I became my sole object of thought;

and at last the gratification of my curiosity about this letter seemed

to me a duty that I owed to myself. As long as my fidgety inquisitiveness

remained ungratified, I felt as if I could not get well. But to do

myself justice, it was more than inquisitiveness. Thekla had tended me

with the gentle, thoughtful care of a sister, in the midst of her busy

life. I could often hear the Frulein's sharp voice outside blaming her

for something that had gone wrong; but I never heard much from Thekla in

reply. Her name was called in various tones by different people, more

frequently than I could count, as if her services were in perpetual

requisition, yet I was never neglected, or even long uncared-for. The

doctor was kind and attentive; my host friendly and really generous; his

sister subdued her acerbity of manner when in my room, but Thekla was

the one of all to whom I owed my comforts, if not my life. If I could do

anything to smooth her path (and a little money goes a great way in

these primitive parts of Germany), how willingly would I give it? So one

night I began--she was no longer needed to watch by my bedside, but she

was arranging my room before leaving me for the night--



""Thekla,"" said I, ""you don't belong to Heppenheim, do you?""



She looked at me, and reddened a little.



""No. Why do you ask?""



""You have been so good to me that I cannot help wanting to know more

about you. I must needs feel interested in one who has been by my side

through my illness as you have. Where do your friends live? Are your

parents alive?""



All this time I was driving at the letter.



""I was born at Altenahr. My father is an innkeeper there. He owns the

'Golden Stag.' My mother is dead, and he has married again, and has many

children.""



""And your stepmother is unkind to you,"" said I, jumping to a conclusion.



""Who said so?"" asked she, with a shade of indignation in her tone. ""She

is a right good woman, and makes my father a good wife.""



""Then why are you here living so far from home?""



Now the look came back to her face which I had seen upon it during the

night hours when I had watched her by stealth; a dimming of the grave

frankness of her eyes, a light quiver at the corners of her mouth. But

all she said was, ""It was better.""



Somehow, I persisted with the wilfulness of an invalid. I am half

ashamed of it now.



""But why better, Thekla? Was there----"" How should I put it? I stopped a

little, and then rushed blindfold at my object: ""Has not that letter

which you read so often something to do with your being here?""



She fixed me with her serious eyes till I believe I reddened far more

than she; and I hastened to pour out, incoherently enough, my conviction

that she had some secret care, and my desire to help her if she was in

any trouble.



""You cannot help me,"" said she, a little softened by my explanation,

though some shade of resentment at having been thus surreptitiously

watched yet lingered in her manner. ""It is an old story; a sorrow gone

by, past, at least it ought to be, only sometimes I am foolish""--her

tones were softening now--""and it is punishment enough that you have

seen my folly.""



""If you had a brother here, Thekla, you would let him give you his

sympathy if he could not give you his help, and you would not blame

yourself if you had shown him your sorrow, should you? I tell you again,

let me be as a brother to you.""



""In the first place, sir""--this ""sir"" was to mark the distinction

between me and the imaginary brother--""I should have been ashamed to

have shown even a brother my sorrow, which is also my reproach and my

disgrace."" These were strong words; and I suppose my face showed that I

attributed to them a still stronger meaning than they warranted; but

_honi soit qui mal y pense_--for she went on dropping her eyes and

speaking hurriedly.



""My shame and my reproach is this: I have loved a man who has not loved

me""--she grasped her hands together till the fingers made deep white

dents in the rosy flesh--""and I can't make out whether he ever did, or

whether he did once and is changed now; if only he did once love me, I

could forgive myself.""



With hasty, trembling hands she began to rearrange the tisane and

medicines for the night on the little table at my bed-side. But, having

got thus far, I was determined to persevere.



""Thekla,"" said I, ""tell me all about it, as you would to your mother, if

she were alive. There are often misunderstandings which, never set to

rights, make the misery and desolation of a life-time.""



She did not speak at first. Then she pulled out the letter, and said, in

a quiet, hopeless tone of voice:--



""You can read German writing? Read that, and see if I have any reason

for misunderstanding.""



The letter was signed ""Franz Weber,"" and dated from some small town in

Switzerland--I forget what--about a month previous to the time when I

read it. It began with acknowledging the receipt of some money which had

evidently been requested by the writer, and for which the thanks were

almost fulsome; and then, by the quietest transition in the world, he

went on to consult her as to the desirability of his marrying some girl

in the place from which he wrote, saying that this Anna Somebody was

only eighteen and very pretty, and her father a well-to-do shopkeeper,

and adding, with coarse coxcombry, his belief that he was not indifferent

to the maiden herself. He wound up by saying that, if this marriage did

take place, he should certainly repay the various sums of money which

Thekla had lent him at different times.



I was some time in making out all this. Thekla held the candle for me to

read it; held it patiently and steadily, not speaking a word till I had

folded up the letter again, and given it back to her. Then our eyes met.



""There is no misunderstanding possible, is there, sir?"" asked she, with

a faint smile.



""No,"" I replied; ""but you are well rid of such a fellow.""



She shook her head a little. ""It shows his bad side, sir. We have all

our bad sides. You must not judge him harshly; at least, I cannot. But

then we were brought up together.""



""At Altenahr?""



""Yes; his father kept the other inn, and our parents, instead of being

rivals, were great friends. Franz is a little younger than I, and was a

delicate child. I had to take him to school, and I used to be so proud

of it and of my charge. Then he grew strong, and was the handsomest lad

in the village. Our fathers used to sit and smoke together, and talk of

our marriage, and Franz must have heard as much as I. Whenever he was in

trouble, he would come to me for what advice I could give him; and he

danced twice as often with me as with any other girl at all the dances,

and always brought his nosegay to me. Then his father wished him to

travel, and learn the ways at the great hotels on the Rhine before he

settled down in Altenahr. You know that is the custom in Germany, sir.

They go from town to town as journeymen, learning something fresh

everywhere, they say.""



""I knew that was done in trades,"" I replied.



""Oh, yes; and among inn-keepers, too,"" she said. ""Most of the waiters

at the great hotels in Frankfort, and Heidelberg, and Mayence, and, I

daresay, at all the other places, are the sons of innkeepers in small

towns, who go out into the world to learn new ways, and perhaps to pick

up a little English and French; otherwise, they say, they should never

get on. Franz went off from Altenahr on his journeyings four years ago

next May-day; and before he went, he brought me back a ring from Bonn,

where he bought his new clothes. I don't wear it now; but I have got it

upstairs, and it comforts me to see something that shows me it was not

all my silly fancy. I suppose he fell among bad people, for he soon

began to play for money,--and then he lost more than he could always

pay--and sometimes I could help him a little, for we wrote to each other

from time to time, as we knew each other's addresses; for the little

ones grew around my father's hearth, and I thought that I, too, would go

forth into the world and earn my own living, so that----well, I will

tell the truth--I thought that by going into service, I could lay by

enough for buying a handsome stock of household linen, and plenty of

pans and kettles against--against what will never come to pass now.""



""Do the German women buy the pots and kettles, as you call them, when

they are married?"" asked I, awkwardly, laying hold of a trivial question

to conceal the indignant sympathy with her wrongs which I did not like

to express.



""Oh, yes; the bride furnishes all that is wanted in the kitchen, and all

the store of house-linen. If my mother had lived, it would have been

laid by for me, as she could have afforded to buy it, but my stepmother

will have hard enough work to provide for her own four little girls.

However,"" she continued, brightening up, ""I can help her, for now I

shall never marry; and my master here is just and liberal, and pays me

sixty florins a year, which is high wages."" (Sixty florins are about

five pounds sterling.) ""And now, good-night, sir. This cup to the left

holds the tisane, that to the right the acorn-tea."" She shaded the

candle, and was leaving the room. I raised myself on my elbow, and

called her back.



""Don't go on thinking about this man,"" said I. ""He was not good enough

for you. You are much better unmarried.""



""Perhaps so,"" she answered gravely. ""But you cannot do him justice; you

do not know him.""



A few minutes after, I heard her soft and cautious return; she had taken

her shoes off, and came in her stockinged feet up to my bedside, shading

the light with her hand. When she saw that my eyes were open, she laid

down two letters on the table, close by my night-lamp.



""Perhaps, some time, sir, you would take the trouble to read these

letters; you would then see how noble and clever Franz really is. It is

I who ought to be blamed, not he.""



No more was said that night.



Some time the next morning I read the letters. They were filled with

vague, inflated, sentimental descriptions of his inner life and feelings;

entirely egotistical, and intermixed with quotations from second-rate

philosophers and poets. There was, it must be said, nothing in them

offensive to good principle or good feeling, however much they might be

opposed to good taste. I was to go into the next room that afternoon for

the first time of leaving my sick chamber. All morning I lay and

ruminated. From time to time I thought of Thekla and Franz Weber. She

was the strong, good, helpful character, he the weak and vain; how

strange it seemed that she should have cared for one so dissimilar;

and then I remembered the various happy marriages when to an outsider

it seemed as if one was so inferior to the other that their union

would have appeared a subject for despair if it had been looked at

prospectively. My host came in, in the midst of these meditations,

bringing a great flowered dressing-gown, lined with flannel, and the

embroidered smoking-cap which he evidently considered as belonging to

this Indian-looking robe. They had been his father's, he told me; and

as he helped me to dress, he went on with his communications on small

family matters. His inn was flourishing; the numbers increased every

year of those who came to see the church at Heppenheim: the church which

was the pride of the place, but which I had never yet seen. It was built

by the great Kaiser Karl. And there was the Castle of Starkenburg, too,

which the Abbots of Lorsch had often defended, stalwart churchmen as

they were, against the temporal power of the emperors. And Melibocus was

not beyond a walk either. In fact, it was the work of one person to

superintend the inn alone; but he had his farm and his vineyards beyond,

which of themselves gave him enough to do. And his sister was oppressed

with the perpetual calls made upon her patience and her nerves in an

inn; and would rather go back and live at Worms. And his children wanted

so much looking after. By the time he had placed himself in a condition

for requiring my full sympathy, I had finished my slow toilette; and I

had to interrupt his confidences, and accept the help of his good strong

arm to lead me into the great eating-room, out of which my chamber opened.

I had a dreamy recollection of the vast apartment. But how pleasantly it

was changed! There was the bare half of the room, it is true, looking as

it had done on that first afternoon, sunless and cheerless, with the

long, unoccupied table, and the necessary chairs for the possible

visitors; but round the windows that opened on the garden a part of the

room was enclosed by the household clothes'-horses hung with great

pieces of the blue homespun cloth of which the dress of the Black Forest

peasant is made. This shut-in space was warmed by the lighted stove, as

well as by the lowering rays of the October sun. There was a little

round walnut table with some flowers upon it, and a great cushioned

armchair placed so as to look out upon the garden and the hills beyond.

I felt sure that this was all Thekla's arrangement; I had rather wondered

that I had seen so little of her this day. She had come once or twice on

necessary errands into my room in the morning, but had appeared to be in

great haste, and had avoided meeting my eye. Even when I had returned

the letters, which she had entrusted to me with so evident a purpose of

placing the writer in my good opinion, she had never inquired as to how

far they had answered her design; she had merely taken them with some

low word of thanks, and put them hurriedly into her pocket. I suppose

she shrank from remembering how fully she had given me her confidence

the night before, now that daylight and actual life pressed close around

her. Besides, there surely never was anyone in such constant request as

Thekla. I did not like this estrangement, though it was the natural

consequence of my improved health, which would daily make me less and

less require services which seemed so urgently claimed by others. And,

moreover, after my host left me--I fear I had cut him a little short

in the recapitulation of his domestic difficulties, but he was too

thorough and good-hearted a man to bear malice--I wanted to be amused or

interested. So I rang my little hand-bell, hoping that Thekla would

answer it, when I could have fallen into conversation with her, without

specifying any decided want. Instead of Thekla the Frulein came, and

I had to invent a wish; for I could not act as a baby, and say that I

wanted my nurse. However, the Frulein was better than no one, so I

asked her if I could have some grapes, which had been provided for me on

every day but this, and which were especially grateful to my feverish

palate. She was a good, kind woman, although, perhaps, her temper was

not the best in the world; and she expressed the sincerest regret as she

told me that there were no more in the house. Like an invalid I fretted

at my wish not being granted, and spoke out.



""But Thekla told me the vintage was not till the fourteenth; and you

have a vineyard close beyond the garden on the slope of the hill out

there, have you not?""



""Yes; and grapes for the gathering. But perhaps the gentleman does not

know our laws. Until the vintage--(the day of beginning the vintage is

fixed by the Grand Duke, and advertised in the public papers)--until

the vintage, all owners of vineyards may only go on two appointed days

in every week to gather their grapes; on those two days (Tuesdays and

Fridays this year) they must gather enough for the wants of their

families; and if they do not reckon rightly, and gather short measure,

why they have to go without. And these two last days the Half-Moon has

been besieged with visitors, all of whom have asked for grapes. But

to-morrow the gentleman can have as many as he will; it is the day for

gathering them.""



""What a strange kind of paternal law,"" I grumbled out. ""Why is it so

ordained? Is it to secure the owners against pilfering from their

unfenced vineyards?""



""I am sure I cannot tell,"" she replied. ""Country people in these

villages have strange customs in many ways, as I daresay the English

gentleman has perceived. If he would come to Worms he would see a

different kind of life.""



""But not a view like this,"" I replied, caught by a sudden change of

light--some cloud passing away from the sun, or something. Right outside

of the windows was, as I have so often said, the garden. Trained

plum-trees with golden leaves, great bushes of purple, Michaelmas daisy,

late flowering roses, apple-trees partly stripped of their rosy fruit,

but still with enough left on their boughs to require the props set to

support the luxuriant burden; to the left an arbour covered over with

honeysuckle and other sweet-smelling creepers--all bounded by a low gray

stone wall which opened out upon the steep vineyard, that stretched up

the hill beyond, one hill of a series rising higher and higher into the

purple distance. ""Why is there a rope with a bunch of straw tied in it

stretched across the opening of the garden into the vineyard?"" I

inquired, as my eye suddenly caught upon the object.



""It is the country way of showing that no one must pass along that path.

To-morrow the gentleman will see it removed; and then he shall have the

grapes. Now I will go and prepare his coffee."" With a curtsey, after

the fashion of Worms gentility, she withdrew. But an under-servant

brought me my coffee; and with her I could not exchange a word: she

spoke in such an execrable patois. I went to bed early, weary, and

depressed. I must have fallen asleep immediately, for I never heard any

one come to arrange my bed-side table; yet in the morning I found that

every usual want or wish of mine had been attended to.



I was wakened by a tap at my door, and a pretty piping child's voice

asking, in broken German, to come in. On giving the usual permission,

Thekla entered, carrying a great lovely boy of two years old, or

thereabouts, who had only his little night-shirt on, and was all flushed

with sleep. He held tight in his hands a great cluster of muscatel and

noble grapes. He seemed like a little Bacchus, as she carried him

towards me with an expression of pretty loving pride upon her face as

she looked at him. But when he came close to me--the grim, wasted,

unshorn--he turned quick away, and hid his face in her neck, still

grasping tight his bunch of grapes. She spoke to him rapidly and softly,

coaxing him as I could tell full well, although I could not follow her

words; and in a minute or two the little fellow obeyed her, and turned

and stretched himself almost to overbalancing out of her arms, and

half-dropped the fruit on the bed by me. Then he clutched at her again,

burying his face in her kerchief, and fastening his little fists in her

luxuriant hair.



[Illustration p. 129: He seemed like a little Bacchus.]



""It is my master's only boy,"" said she, disentangling his fingers with

quiet patience, only to have them grasp her braids afresh. ""He is my

little Max, my heart's delight, only he must not pull so hard. Say his

'to-meet-again,' and kiss his hand lovingly, and we will go."" The

promise of a speedy departure from my dusky room proved irresistible;

he babbled out his Aufwiedersehen, and kissing his chubby hand, he was

borne away joyful and chattering fast in his infantile half-language. I

did not see Thekla again until late afternoon, when she brought me in

my coffee. She was not like the same creature as the blooming, cheerful

maiden whom I had seen in the morning; she looked wan and careworn,

older by several years.



""What is the matter, Thekla?"" said I, with true anxiety as to what might

have befallen my good, faithful nurse.



She looked round before answering. ""I have seen him,"" she said. ""He has

been here, and the Frulein has been so angry! She says she will tell my

master. Oh, it has been such a day!"" The poor young woman, who was

usually so composed and self-restrained, was on the point of bursting

into tears; but by a strong effort she checked herself, and tried to

busy herself with rearranging the white china cup, so as to place it

more conveniently to my hand.



""Come, Thekla,"" said I, ""tell me all about it. I have heard loud voices

talking, and I fancied something had put the Frulein out; and Lottchen

looked flurried when she brought me my dinner. Is Franz here? How has he

found you out?""



""He is here. Yes, I am sure it is he; but four years makes such a

difference in a man; his whole look and manner seemed so strange to me;

but he knew me at once, and called me all the old names which we used to

call each other when we were children; and he must needs tell me how it

had come to pass that he had not married that Swiss Anna. He said he had

never loved her; and that now he was going home to settle, and he hoped

that I would come too, and----"" There she stopped short.



""And marry him, and live at the inn at Altenahr,"" said I, smiling, to

reassure her, though I felt rather disappointed about the whole affair.



""No,"" she replied. ""Old Weber, his father, is dead; he died in debt, and

Franz will have no money. And he was always one that needed money. Some

are, you know; and while I was thinking, and he was standing near me,

the Frulein came in; and--and--I don't wonder--for poor Franz is not

a pleasant-looking man now-a-days--she was very angry, and called me

a bold, bad girl, and said she could have no such goings on at the

'Halbmond,' but would tell my master when he came home from the forest.""



""But you could have told her that you were old friends."" I hesitated,

before saying the word lovers, but, after a pause, out it came.



""Franz might have said so,"" she replied, a little stiffly. ""I could not;

but he went off as soon as she bade him. He went to the 'Adler' over the

way, only saying he would come for my answer to-morrow morning. I think

it was he that should have told her what we were--neighbours' children

and early friends--not have left it all to me. Oh,"" said she, clasping

her hands tight together, ""she will make such a story of it to my

master.""



""Never mind,"" said I, ""tell the master I want to see him, as soon as he

comes in from the forest, and trust me to set him right before the

Frulein has the chance to set him wrong.""



She looked up at me gratefully, and went away without any more words.

Presently the fine burly figure of my host stood at the opening to my

enclosed sitting-room. He was there, three-cornered hat in hand, looking

tired and heated as a man does after a hard day's work, but as kindly

and genial as ever, which is not what every man is who is called to

business after such a day, before he has had the necessary food and

rest.



I had been reflecting a good deal on Thekla's story; I could not quite

interpret her manner to-day to my full satisfaction; but yet the love

which had grown with her growth, must assuredly have been called forth

by her lover's sudden reappearance; and I was inclined to give him some

credit for having broken off an engagement to Swiss Anna, which had

promised so many worldly advantages; and, again, I had considered that

if he was a little weak and sentimental, it was Thekla, who would marry

him by her own free will, and perhaps she had sense and quiet resolution

enough for both. So I gave the heads of the little history I have

told you to my good friend and host, adding that I should like to

have a man's opinion of this man; but that if he were not an absolute

good-for-nothing, and if Thekla still loved him, as I believed, I would

try and advance them the requisite money towards establishing themselves

in the hereditary inn at Altenahr.



Such was the romantic ending to Thekla's sorrows, I had been planning

and brooding over for the last hour. As I narrated my tale, and hinted

at the possible happy conclusion that might be in store, my host's

face changed. The ruddy colour faded, and his look became almost

stern--certainly very grave in expression. It was so unsympathetic, that

I instinctively cut my words short. When I had done, he paused a little,

and then said: ""You would wish me to learn all I can respecting this

stranger now at the 'Adler,' and give you the impression I receive of

the fellow.""



""Exactly so,"" said I; ""I want to learn all I can about him for Thekla's

sake.""



""For Thekla's sake I will do it,"" he gravely repeated.



""And come to me to-night, even if I am gone to bed?""



""Not so,"" he replied. ""You must give me all the time you can in a matter

like this.""



""But he will come for Thekla's answer in the morning.""



""Before he comes you shall know all I can learn.""



I was resting during the fatigues of dressing the next day, when my host

tapped at my door. He looked graver and sterner than I had ever seen him

do before; he sat down almost before I had begged him to do so.



""He is not worthy of her,"" he said. ""He drinks brandy right hard; he

boasts of his success at play, and""--here he set his teeth hard--""he

boasts of the women who have loved him. In a village like this, sir,

there are always those who spend their evenings in the gardens of the

inns; and this man, after he had drank his fill, made no secrets; it

needed no spying to find out what he was, else I should not have been

the one to do it.""



""Thekla must be told of this,"" said I. ""She is not the woman to love any

one whom she cannot respect.""



Herr Mller laughed a low bitter laugh, quite unlike himself. Then he

replied,--



""As for that matter, sir, you are young; you have had no great experience

of women. From what my sister tells me there can be little doubt of

Thekla's feeling towards him. She found them standing together by the

window; his arm round Thekla's waist, and whispering in her ear--and to

do the maiden justice she is not the one to suffer such familiarities

from every one. No""--continued he, still in the same contemptuous

tone--""you'll find she will make excuses for his faults and vices; or

else, which is perhaps more likely, she will not believe your story,

though I who tell it you can vouch for the truth of every word I say.""

He turned short away and left the room. Presently I saw his stalwart

figure in the hill-side vineyard, before my windows, scaling the steep

ascent with long regular steps, going to the forest beyond. I was

otherwise occupied than in watching his progress during the next hour;

at the end of that time he re-entered my room, looking heated and

slightly tired, as if he had been walking fast, or labouring hard; but

with the cloud off his brows, and the kindly light shining once again

out of his honest eyes.



""I ask your pardon, sir,"" he began, ""for troubling you afresh. I believe

I was possessed by the devil this morning. I have been thinking it over.

One has perhaps no right to rule for another person's happiness. To have

such a""--here the honest fellow choked a little--""such a woman as Thekla

to love him ought to raise any man. Besides, I am no judge for him or

for her. I have found out this morning that I love her myself, and so the

end of it is, that if you, sir, who are so kind as to interest yourself

in the matter, and if you think it is really her heart's desire to marry

this man--which ought to be his salvation both for earth and heaven--I

shall be very glad to go halves with you in any place for setting them

up in the inn at Altenahr; only allow me to see that whatever money we

advance is well and legally tied up, so that it is secured to her. And

be so kind as to take no notice of what I have said about my having

found out that I have loved her; I named it as a kind of apology for my

hard words this morning, and as a reason why I was not a fit judge of

what was best."" He had hurried on, so that I could not have stopped his

eager speaking even had I wished to do so; but I was too much interested

in the revelation of what was passing in his brave tender heart to

desire to stop him. Now, however, his rapid words tripped each other up,

and his speech ended in an unconscious sigh.



""But,"" I said, ""since you were here Thekla has come to me, and we have

had a long talk. She speaks now as openly to me as she would if I were

her brother; with sensible frankness, where frankness is wise, with

modest reticence, where confidence would be unbecoming. She came to

ask me, if I thought it her duty to marry this fellow, whose very

appearance, changed for the worse, as she says it is, since she last

saw him four years ago, seemed to have repelled her.""



""She could let him put his arm round her waist yesterday,"" said Herr

Mller, with a return of his morning's surliness.



""And she would marry him now if she could believe it to be her duty.

For some reason of his own, this Franz Weber has tried to work upon this

feeling of hers. He says it would be the saving of him.""



""As if a man had not strength enough in him--a man who is good for

aught--to save himself, but needed a woman to pull him through life!""



""Nay,"" I replied, hardly able to keep from smiling. ""You yourself said,

not five minutes ago, that her marrying him might be his salvation both

for earth and heaven.""



""That was when I thought she loved the fellow,"" he answered quick.

""Now----but what did you say to her, sir?""



""I told her, what I believe to be as true as gospel, that as she owned

she did not love him any longer now his real self had come to displace

his remembrance, that she would be sinning in marrying him; doing evil

that possible good might come. I was clear myself on this point, though

I should have been perplexed how to advise, if her love had still

continued.""



""And what answer did she make?""



""She went over the history of their lives; she was pleading against her

wishes to satisfy her conscience. She said that all along through their

childhood she had been his strength; that while under her personal

influence he had been negatively good; away from her, he had fallen into

mischief--""



""Not to say vice,"" put in Herr Mller.



""And now he came to her penitent, in sorrow, desirous of amendment,

asking her for the love she seems to have considered as tacitly plighted

to him in years gone by--""



""And which he has slighted and insulted. I hope you told her of his

words and conduct last night in the 'Adler' gardens?""



""No. I kept myself to the general principle, which, I am sure, is a

true one. I repeated it in different forms; for the idea of the duty

of self-sacrifice had taken strong possession of her fancy. Perhaps,

if I had failed in setting her notion of her duty in the right aspect,

I might have had recourse to the statement of facts, which would have

pained her severely, but would have proved to her how little his words

of penitence and promises of amendment were to be trusted to.""



""And it ended?""



""Ended by her being quite convinced that she would be doing wrong

instead of right if she married a man whom she had entirely ceased to

love, and that no real good could come from a course of action based on

wrong-doing.""



""That is right and true,"" he replied, his face broadening into happiness

again.



""But she says she must leave your service, and go elsewhere.""



""Leave my service she shall; go elsewhere she shall not.""



""I cannot tell what you may have the power of inducing her to do; but

she seems to me very resolute.""



""Why?"" said he, firing round at me, as if I had made her resolute.



""She says your sister spoke to her before the maids of the household,

and before some of the townspeople, in a way that she could not stand;

and that you yourself by your manner to her last night showed how she

had lost your respect. She added, with her face of pure maidenly truth,

that he had come into such close contact with her only the instant

before your sister had entered the room.""



""With your leave, sir,"" said Herr Mller, turning towards the door, ""I

will go and set all that right at once.""



It was easier said than done. When I next saw Thekla, her eyes were

swollen up with crying, but she was silent, almost defiant towards

me. A look of resolute determination had settled down upon her face. I

learnt afterwards that parts of my conversation with Herr Mller had been

injudiciously quoted by him in the talk he had had with her. I thought I

would leave her to herself, and wait till she unburdened herself of the

feeling of unjust resentment towards me. But it was days before she

spoke to me with anything like her former frankness. I had heard all

about it from my host long before.



He had gone to her straight on leaving me; and like a foolish, impetuous

lover, had spoken out his mind and his wishes to her in the presence of

his sister, who, it must be remembered, had heard no explanation of the

conduct which had given her propriety so great a shock the day before.

Herr Mller thought to re-instate Thekla in his sister's good opinion by

giving her in the Frulein's very presence the highest possible mark of

his own love and esteem. And there in the kitchen, where the Frulein

was deeply engaged in the hot work of making some delicate preserve

on the stove, and ordering Thekla about with short, sharp displeasure

in her tones, the master had come in, and possessing himself of the

maiden's hand, had, to her infinite surprise--to his sister's infinite

indignation--made her the offer of his heart, his wealth, his life; had

begged of her to marry him. I could gather from his account that she had

been in a state of trembling discomfiture at first; she had not spoken,

but had twisted her hand out of his, and had covered her face with her

apron. And then the Frulein had burst forth--""accursed words"" he called

her speech. Thekla uncovered her face to listen; to listen to the end;

to listen to the passionate recrimination between the brother and the

sister. And then she went up, close up to the angry Frulein, and had

said quite quietly, but with a manner of final determination which had

evidently sunk deep into her suitor's heart, and depressed him into

hopelessness, that the Frulein had no need to disturb herself; that on

this very day she had been thinking of marrying another man, and that

her heart was not like a room to let, into which as one tenant went out

another might enter. Nevertheless, she felt the master's goodness. He

had always treated her well from the time when she had entered the house

as his servant. And she should be sorry to leave him; sorry to leave the

children; very sorry to leave little Max: yes, she should even be sorry

to leave the Frulein, who was a good woman, only a little too apt

to be hard on other women. But she had already been that very day and

deposited her warning at the police office; the busy time would be soon

over, and she should be glad to leave their service on All Saints' Day.

Then (he thought) she had felt inclined to cry, for she suddenly braced

herself up, and said, yes, she should be very glad; for somehow, though

they had been kind to her, she had been very unhappy at Heppenheim; and

she would go back to her home for a time, and see her old father and

kind stepmother, and her nursling half-sister Ida, and be among her own

people again.



I could see it was this last part that most of all rankled in Herr

Mller's mind. In all probability Franz Weber was making his way back to

Heppenheim too; and the bad suspicion would keep welling up that some

lingering feeling for her old lover and disgraced playmate was making

her so resolute to leave and return to Altenahr.



For some days after this I was the confidant of the whole household,

excepting Thekla. She, poor creature, looked miserable enough; but the

hardy, defiant expression was always on her face. Lottchen spoke out

freely enough; the place would not be worth having if Thekla left it; it

was she who had the head for everything, the patience for everything;

who stood between all the under-servants and the Frulein's tempers. As

for the children, poor motherless children! Lottchen was sure that the

master did not know what he was doing when he allowed his sister to turn

Thekla away--and all for what? for having a lover, as every girl had who

could get one. Why, the little boy Max slept in the room which Lottchen

shared with Thekla; and she heard him in the night as quickly as if she

was his mother; when she had been sitting up with me, when I was so ill,

Lottchen had had to attend to him; and it was weary work after a hard

day to have to get up and soothe a teething child; she knew she had been

cross enough sometimes; but Thekla was always good and gentle with him,

however tired he was. And as Lottchen left the room I could hear her

repeating that she thought she should leave when Thekla went, for that

her place would not be worth having.



Even the Frulein had her word of regret--regret mingled with

self-justification. She thought she had been quite right in speaking to

Thekla for allowing such familiarities; how was she to know that the man

was an old friend and playmate? He looked like a right profligate

good-for-nothing. And to have a servant take up her scolding as an

unpardonable offence, and persist in quitting her place, just when she

had learnt all her work, and was so useful in the household--so

useful that the Frulein could never put up with any fresh, stupid

house-maiden, but, sooner than take the trouble of teaching the new

servant where everything was, and how to give out the stores if she was

busy, she would go back to Worms. For, after all, housekeeping for a

brother was thankless work; there was no satisfying men; and Heppenheim

was but a poor ignorant village compared to Worms.



She must have spoken to her brother about her intention of leaving him,

and returning to her former home; indeed a feeling of coolness had

evidently grown up between the brother and sister during these latter

days. When one evening Herr Mller brought in his pipe, and, as his

custom had sometimes been, sat down by my stove to smoke, he looked

gloomy and annoyed. I let him puff away, and take his own time. At

length he began,--



""I have rid the village of him at last. I could not bear to have him

here disgracing Thekla with speaking to her whenever she went to the

vineyard or the fountain. I don't believe she likes him a bit.""



""No more do I,"" I said. He turned on me.



""Then why did she speak to him at all? Why cannot she like an honest man

who likes her? Why is she so bent on going home to Altenahr?""



""She speaks to him because she has known him from a child, and has a

faithful pity for one whom she has known so innocent, and who is now so

lost in all good men's regard. As for not liking an honest man--(though

I may have my own opinion about that)--liking goes by fancy, as we say

in English; and Altenahr is her home; her father's house is at Altenahr,

as you know.""



""I wonder if he will go there,"" quoth Herr Mller, after two or three

more puffs. ""He was fast at the 'Adler;' he could not pay his score, so

he kept on staying here, saying that he should receive a letter from a

friend with money in a day or two; lying in wait, too, for Thekla, who

is well-known and respected all through Heppenheim: so his being an old

friend of hers made him have a kind of standing. I went in this morning

and paid his score, on condition that he left the place this day; and he

left the village as merrily as a cricket, caring no more for Thekla than

for the Kaiser who built our church: for he never looked back at the

'Halbmond,' but went whistling down the road.""



""That is a good riddance,"" said I.



""Yes. But my sister says she must return to Worms. And Lottchen has

given notice; she says the place will not be worth having when Thekla

leaves. I wish I could give notice too.""



""Try Thekla again.""



""Not I,"" said he, reddening. ""It would seem now as if I only wanted her

for a housekeeper. Besides, she avoids me at every turn, and will not

even look at me. I am sure she bears me some ill-will about that

ne'er-do-well.""



There was silence between us for some time, which he at length broke.



""The pastor has a good and comely daughter. Her mother is a famous

housewife. They often have asked me to come to the parsonage and smoke a

pipe. When the vintage is over, and I am less busy, I think I will go

there, and look about me.""



""When is the vintage?"" asked I. ""I hope it will take place soon, for I

am growing so well and strong I fear I must leave you shortly; but I

should like to see the vintage first.""



""Oh, never fear! you must not travel yet awhile; and Government has

fixed the grape-gathering to begin on the fourteenth.""



""What a paternal Government! How does it know when the grapes will be

ripe? Why cannot every man fix his own time for gathering his own

grapes?""



""That has never been our way in Germany. There are people employed by

the Government to examine the vines, and report when the grapes are

ripe. It is necessary to make laws about it; for, as you must have seen,

there is nothing but the fear of the law to protect our vineyards and

fruit-trees; there are no enclosures along the Berg-Strasse, as you tell

me you have in England; but, as people are only allowed to go into the

vineyards on stated days, no one, under pretence of gathering his own

produce, can stray into his neighbour's grounds and help himself,

without some of the duke's foresters seeing him.""



""Well,"" said I, ""to each country its own laws.""



I think it was on that very evening that Thekla came in for something.

She stopped arranging the tablecloth and the flowers, as if she had

something to say, yet did not know how to begin. At length I found that

her sore, hot heart, wanted some sympathy; her hand was against every

one's, and she fancied every one had turned against her. She looked up

at me, and said, a little abruptly,--



""Does the gentleman know that I go on the fifteenth?""



""So soon?"" said I, with surprise. ""I thought you were to remain here

till All Saints' Day.""



""So I should have done--so I must have done--if the Frulein had not

kindly given me leave to accept of a place--a very good place too--of

housekeeper to a widow lady at Frankfort. It is just the sort of

situation I have always wished for. I expect I shall be so happy and

comfortable there.""



""Methinks the lady doth profess too much,"" came into my mind. I saw she

expected me to doubt the probability of her happiness, and was in a

defiant mood.



""Of course,"" said I, ""you would hardly have wished to leave Heppenheim

if you had been happy here; and every new place always promises fair,

whatever its performance may be. But wherever you go, remember you have

always a friend in me.""



""Yes,"" she replied, ""I think you are to be trusted. Though, from my

experience, I should say that of very few men.""



""You have been unfortunate,"" I answered; ""many men would say the same of

women.""



She thought a moment, and then said, in a changed tone of voice, ""The

Frulein here has been much more friendly and helpful of these late

days than her brother; yet I have served him faithfully, and have cared

for his little Max as though he were my own brother. But this morning he

spoke to me for the first time for many days,--he met me in the passage,

and, suddenly stopping, he said he was glad I had met with so comfortable

a place, and that I was at full liberty to go whenever I liked: and then

he went quickly on, never waiting for my answer.""



""And what was wrong in that? It seems to me he was trying to make you

feel entirely at your ease, to do as you thought best, without regard to

his own interests.""



""Perhaps so. It is silly, I know,"" she continued, turning full on me her

grave, innocent eyes; ""but one's vanity suffers a little when every one

is so willing to part with one.""



""Thekla! I owe you a great debt--let me speak to you openly. I know

that your master wanted to marry you, and that you refused him. Do not

deceive yourself. You are sorry for that refusal now?""



She kept her serious look fixed upon me; but her face and throat

reddened all over.



""No,"" said she, at length; ""I am not sorry. What can you think I am

made of; having loved one man ever since I was a little child until a

fortnight ago, and now just as ready to love another? I know you do not

rightly consider what you say, or I should take it as an insult.""



""You loved an ideal man; he disappointed you, and you clung to your

remembrance of him. He came, and the reality dispelled all illusions.""



""I do not understand philosophy,"" said she. ""I only know that I think

that Herr Mller had lost all respect for me from what his sister had

told him; and I know that I am going away; and I trust I shall be

happier in Frankfort than I have been here of late days."" So saying, she

left the room.



I was wakened up on the morning of the fourteenth by the merry ringing

of church bells, and the perpetual firing and popping off of guns and

pistols. But all this was over by the time I was up and dressed, and

seated at breakfast in my partitioned room. It was a perfect October

day; the dew not yet off the blades of grass, glistening on the delicate

gossamer webs, which stretched from flower to flower in the garden,

lying in the morning shadow of the house. But beyond the garden, on

the sunny hill-side, men, women, and children were clambering up the

vineyards like ants,--busy, irregular in movement, clustering together,

spreading wide apart,--I could hear the shrill merry voices as I

sat,--and all along the valley, as far as I could see, it was much the

same; for every one filled his house for the day of the vintage, that

great annual festival. Lottchen, who had brought in my breakfast, was

all in her Sunday best, having risen early to get her work done and go

abroad to gather grapes. Bright colours seemed to abound; I could see

dots of scarlet, and crimson, and orange through the fading leaves; it

was not a day to languish in the house; and I was on the point of going

out by myself, when Herr Mller came in to offer me his sturdy arm, and

help me in walking to the vineyard. We crept through the garden scented

with late flowers and sunny fruit,--we passed through the gate I had so

often gazed at from the easy-chair, and were in the busy vineyard; great

baskets lay on the grass already piled nearly full of purple and yellow

grapes. The wine made from these was far from pleasant to my taste; for

the best Rhine wine is made from a smaller grape, growing in closer,

harder clusters; but the larger and less profitable grape is by far the

most picturesque in its mode of growth, and far the best to eat into the

bargain. Wherever we trod, it was on fragrant, crushed vine-leaves;

every one we saw had his hands and face stained with the purple juice.

Presently I sat down on a sunny bit of grass, and my host left me to go

farther afield, to look after the more distant vineyards. I watched his

progress. After he left me, he took off coat and waistcoat, displaying

his snowy shirt and gaily-worked braces; and presently he was as busy

as any one. I looked down on the village; the gray and orange and

crimson roofs lay glowing in the noonday sun. I could see down into the

streets; but they were all empty--even the old people came toiling up

the hill-side to share in the general festivity. Lottchen had brought up

cold dinners for a regiment of men; every one came and helped himself.

Thekla was there, leading the little Karoline, and helping the toddling

steps of Max; but she kept aloof from me; for I knew, or suspected, or

had probed too much. She alone looked sad and grave, and spoke so

little, even to her friends, that it was evident to see that she was

trying to wean herself finally from the place. But I could see that she

had lost her short, defiant manner. What she did say was kindly and

gently spoken. The Frulein came out late in the morning, dressed, I

suppose, in the latest Worms fashion--quite different to anything I had

ever seen before. She came up to me, and talked very graciously to me

for some time.



""Here comes the proprietor (squire) and his lady, and their dear

children. See, the vintagers have tied bunches of the finest grapes on

to a stick, heavier than the children or even the lady can carry. Look!

look! how he bows!--one can tell he has been an _attach_ at Vienna.

That is the court way of bowing there--holding the hat right down before

them, and bending the back at right angles. How graceful! And here is

the doctor! I thought he would spare time to come up here. Well, doctor,

you will go all the more cheerfully to your next patient for having been

up into the vineyards. Nonsense, about grapes making other patients for

you. Ah, here is the pastor and his wife, and the Frulein Anna. Now,

where is my brother, I wonder? Up in the far vineyard, I make no doubt.

Mr. Pastor, the view up above is far finer than what it is here, and the

best grapes grow there; shall I accompany you and madame, and the dear

Frulein? The gentleman will excuse me.""



I was left alone. Presently I thought I would walk a little farther,

or at any rate change my position. I rounded a corner in the pathway,

and there I found Thekla, watching by little sleeping Max. He lay on

her shawl; and over his head she had made an arching canopy of broken

vine-branches, so that the great leaves threw their cool, flickering

shadows on his face. He was smeared all over with grape-juice, his

sturdy fingers grasped a half-eaten bunch even in his sleep. Thekla was

keeping Lina quiet by teaching her how to weave a garland for her head

out of field-flowers and autumn-tinted leaves. The maiden sat on the

ground, with her back to the valley beyond, the child kneeling by her,

watching the busy fingers with eager intentness. Both looked up as I

drew near, and we exchanged a few words.



""Where is the master?"" I asked. ""I promised to await his return; he

wished to give me his arm down the wooden steps; but I do not see him.""



""He is in the higher vineyard,"" said Thekla, quietly, but not looking

round in that direction. ""He will be some time there, I should think.

He went with the pastor and his wife; he will have to speak to his

labourers and his friends. My arm is strong, and I can leave Max in

Lina's care for five minutes. If you are tired, and want to go back, let

me help you down the steps; they are steep and slippery.""



I had turned to look up the valley. Three or four hundred yards off,

in the higher vineyard, walked the dignified pastor, and his homely,

decorous wife. Behind came the Frulein Anna, in her short-sleeved

Sunday gown, daintily holding a parasol over her luxuriant brown

hair. Close behind her came Herr Mller, stopping now to speak to his

men,--again, to cull out a bunch of grapes to tie on to the Frulein's

stick; and by my feet sate the proud serving-maid in her country dress,

waiting for my answer, with serious, up-turned eyes, and sad, composed

face.



""No, I am much obliged to you, Thekla; and if I did not feel so strong I

would have thankfully taken your arm. But I only wanted to leave a

message for the master, just to say that I have gone home.""



""Lina will give it to the father when he comes down,"" said Thekla.



I went slowly down into the garden. The great labour of the day was

over, and the younger part of the population had returned to the

village, and were preparing the fireworks and pistol-shootings for the

evening. Already one or two of those well-known German carts (in the

shape of a V) were standing near the vineyard gates, the patient oxen

meekly waiting while basketful after basketful of grapes were being

emptied into the leaf-lined receptacle.



As I sat down in my easy-chair close to the open window through which I

had entered, I could see the men and women on the hill-side drawing to a

centre, and all stand round the pastor, bareheaded, for a minute or so.

I guessed that some words of holy thanksgiving were being said, and I

wished that I had stayed to hear them, and mark my especial gratitude

for having been spared to see that day. Then I heard the distant

voices, the deep tones of the men, the shriller pipes of women and

children, join in the German harvest-hymn, which is generally sung on

such occasions;[1] then silence, while I concluded that a blessing was

spoken by the pastor, with outstretched arms; and then they once more

dispersed, some to the village, some to finish their labours for the day

among the vines. I saw Thekla coming through the garden with Max in her

arms, and Lina clinging to her woollen skirts. Thekla made for my open

window; it was rather a shorter passage into the house than round by the

door. ""I may come through, may I not?"" she asked, softly. ""I fear Max is

not well; I cannot understand his look, and he wakened up so strange!""

She paused to let me see the child's face; it was flushed almost to a

crimson look of heat, and his breathing was laboured and uneasy, his

eyes half-open and filmy.



""Something is wrong, I am sure,"" said I. ""I don't know anything about

children, but he is not in the least like himself.""



She bent down and kissed the cheek so tenderly that she would not have

bruised the petal of a rose. ""Heart's darling,"" she murmured. He

quivered all over at her touch, working his fingers in an unnatural kind

of way, and ending with a convulsive twitching all over his body. Lina

began to cry at the grave, anxious look on our faces.



""You had better call the Frulein to look at him,"" said I. ""I feel sure

he ought to have a doctor; I should say he was going to have a fit.""



""The Frulein and the master are gone to the pastor's for coffee, and

Lottchen is in the higher vineyard, taking the men their bread and beer.

Could you find the kitchen girl, or old Karl? he will be in the stables,

I think. I must lose no time."" Almost without waiting for my reply, she

had passed through the room, and in the empty house I could hear her

firm, careful footsteps going up the stair; Lina's pattering beside her;

and the one voice wailing, the other speaking low comfort.



I was tired enough, but this good family had treated me too much like

one of their own for me not to do what I could in such a case as this. I

made my way out into the street, for the first time since I had come to

the house on that memorable evening six weeks ago. I bribed the first

person I met to guide me to the doctor's, and send him straight down to

the ""Halbmond,"" not staying to listen to the thorough scolding he fell

to giving me; then on to the parsonage, to tell the master and the

Frulein of the state of things at home.



I was sorry to be the bearer of bad news into such a festive chamber

as the pastor's. There they sat, resting after heat and fatigue, each

in their best gala dress, the table spread with ""Dicker-milch,""

potato-salad, cakes of various shapes and kinds--all the dainty cates

dear to the German palate. The pastor was talking to Herr Mller,

who stood near the pretty young Frulein Anna, in her fresh white

chemisette, with her round white arms, and her youthful coquettish airs,

as she prepared to pour out the coffee; our Frulein was talking busily

to the Frau Mama; the younger boys and girls of the family filling up

the room. A ghost would have startled the assembled party less than I

did, and would probably have been more welcome, considering the news I

brought. As he listened, the master caught up his hat and went forth,

without apology or farewell. Our Frulein made up for both, and

questioned me fully; but now she, I could see, was in haste to go,

although restrained by her manners, and the kind-hearted Frau Pastorin

soon set her at liberty to follow her inclination. As for me I was

dead-beat, and only too glad to avail myself of the hospitable couple's

pressing request that I would stop and share their meal. Other magnates

of the village came in presently, and relieved me of the strain of

keeping up a German conversation about nothing at all with entire

strangers. The pretty Frulein's face had clouded over a little at Herr

Mller's sudden departure; but she was soon as bright as could be,

giving private chase and sudden little scoldings to her brothers, as

they made raids upon the dainties under her charge. After I was duly

rested and refreshed, I took my leave; for I, too, had my quieter

anxieties about the sorrow in the Mller family.



The only person I could see at the ""Halbmond"" was Lottchen; every one

else was busy about the poor little Max, who was passing from one fit

into another. I told Lottchen to ask the doctor to come in and see me

before he took his leave for the night, and tired as I was, I kept up

till after his visit, though it was very late before he came; I could

see from his face how anxious he was. He would give me no opinion as to

the child's chances of recovery, from which I guessed that he had not

much hope. But when I expressed my fear he cut me very short.



""The truth is, you know nothing about it; no more do I, for that matter.

It is enough to try any man, much less a father, to hear his perpetual

moans--not that he is conscious of pain, poor little worm; but if she

stops for a moment in her perpetual carrying him backwards and forwards,

he plains so piteously it is enough to--enough to make a man bless the

Lord who never led him into the pit of matrimony. To see the father up

there, following her as she walks up and down the room, the child's head

over her shoulder, and Mller trying to make the heavy eyes recognize

the old familiar ways of play, and the chirruping sounds which he can

scarce make for crying----I shall be here to-morrow early, though before

that either life or death will have come without the old doctor's help.""



All night long I dreamt my feverish dream--of the vineyard--the carts,

which held little coffins instead of baskets of grapes--of the pastor's

daughter, who would pull the dying child out of Thekla's arms; it was

a bad, weary night! I slept long into the morning; the broad daylight

filled my room, and yet no one had been near to waken me! Did that mean

life or death? I got up and dressed as fast as I could; for I was aching

all over with the fatigue of the day before. Out into the sitting-room;

the table was laid for breakfast, but no one was there. I passed into

the house beyond, up the stairs, blindly seeking for the room where I

might know whether it was life or death. At the door of a room I found

Lottchen crying; at the sight of me in that unwonted place she started,

and began some kind of apology, broken both by tears and smiles, as she

told me that the doctor said the danger was over--past, and that Max was

sleeping a gentle peaceful slumber in Thekla's arms--arms that had held

him all through the livelong night.



""Look at him, sir; only go in softly; it is a pleasure to see the child

to-day; tread softly, sir.""



She opened the chamber-door. I could see Thekla sitting, propped up by

cushions and stools, holding her heavy burden, and bending over him with

a look of tenderest love. Not far off stood the Frulein, all disordered

and tearful, stirring or seasoning some hot soup, while the master stood

by her impatient. As soon as it was cooled or seasoned enough he took

the basin and went to Thekla, and said something very low; she lifted up

her head, and I could see her face; pale, weary with watching, but with

a soft peaceful look upon it, which it had not worn for weeks. Fritz

Mller began to feed her, for her hands were occupied in holding his

child; I could not help remembering Mrs. Inchbald's pretty description

of Dorriforth's anxiety in feeding Miss Milner; she compares it, if I

remember rightly, to that of a tender-hearted boy, caring for his

darling bird, the loss of which would embitter all the joys of his

holidays. We closed the door without noise, so as not to waken the

sleeping child. Lottchen brought me my coffee and bread; she was ready

either to laugh or to weep on the slightest occasion. I could not tell

if it was in innocence or mischief. She asked me the following

question,--



""Do you think Thekla will leave to-day, sir?""



In the afternoon I heard Thekla's step behind my extemporary screen. I

knew it quite well. She stopped for a moment before emerging into my

view.



She was trying to look as composed as usual, but, perhaps because her

steady nerves had been shaken by her night's watching, she could not

help faint touches of dimples at the corners of her mouth, and her eyes

were veiled from any inquisitive look by their drooping lids.



""I thought you would like to know that the doctor says Max is quite out

of danger now. He will only require care.""



""Thank you, Thekla; Doctor ---- has been in already this afternoon to

tell me so, and I am truly glad.""



She went to the window, and looked out for a moment. Many people were in

the vineyards again to-day; although we, in our household anxiety, had

paid them but little heed. Suddenly she turned round into the room, and

I saw that her face was crimson with blushes. In another instant Herr

Mller entered by the window.



""Has she told you, sir?"" said he, possessing himself of her hand, and

looking all a-glow with happiness. ""Hast thou told our good friend?""

addressing her.



""No. I was going to tell him, but I did not know how to begin.""



""Then I will prompt thee. Say after me--'I have been a wilful, foolish

woman----'""



She wrenched her hand out of his, half-laughing--""I am a foolish woman,

for I have promised to marry him. But he is a still more foolish man,

for he wishes to marry me. That is what I say.""



""And I have sent Babette to Frankfort with the pastor. He is going

there, and will explain all to Frau v. Schmidt; and Babette will serve

her for a time. When Max is well enough to have the change of air the

doctor prescribes for him, thou shalt take him to Altenahr, and thither

will I also go; and become known to thy people and thy father. And

before Christmas the gentleman here shall dance at our wedding.""



""I must go home to England, dear friends, before many days are over.

Perhaps we may travel together as far as Remagen. Another year I will

come back to Heppenheim and see you.""



As I planned it, so it was. We left Heppenheim all together on a lovely

All-Saints' Day. The day before--the day of All-Souls--I had watched

Fritz and Thekla lead little Lina up to the Acre of God, the Field of

Rest, to hang the wreath of immortelles on her mother's grave. Peace be

with the dead and the living.









LIBBIE MARSH'S THREE ERAS.



ERA I.



VALENTINE'S DAY.





Last November but one, there was a flitting in our neighbourhood; hardly

a flitting, after all, for it was only a single person changing her

place of abode from one lodging to another; and instead of a cartload of

drawers and baskets, dressers and beds, with old king clock at the top

of all, it was only one large wooden chest to be carried after the girl,

who moved slowly and heavily along the streets, listless and depressed,

more from the state of her mind than of her body. It was Libbie Marsh,

who had been obliged to quit her room in Dean Street, because the

acquaintances whom she had been living with were leaving Manchester. She

tried to think herself fortunate in having met with lodgings rather more

out of the town, and with those who were known to be respectable; she

did indeed try to be contented, but in spite of her reason, the old

feeling of desolation came over her, as she was now about to be thrown

again entirely among strangers.



No. 2, ---- Court, Albemarle Street, was reached at last, and the pace,

slow as it was, slackened as she drew near the spot where she was to be

left by the man who carried her box, for, trivial as her acquaintance

with him was, he was not quite a stranger, as every one else was,

peering out of their open doors, and satisfying themselves it was only

""Dixon's new lodger.""



Dixon's house was the last on the left-hand side of the court. A high

dead brick wall connected it with its opposite neighbour. All the

dwellings were of the same monotonous pattern, and one side of the court

looked at its exact likeness opposite, as if it were seeing itself in a

looking-glass.



Dixon's house was shut up, and the key left next door; but the woman in

whose charge it was left knew that Libbie was expected, and came forward

to say a few explanatory words, to unlock the door, and stir the dull

grey ashes that were lazily burning in the grate: and then she returned

to her own house, leaving poor Libbie standing alone with the great big

chest in the middle of the house-place floor, with no one to say a word

to (even a common-place remark would have been better than this dull

silence), that could help her to repel the fast-coming tears.



Dixon and his wife, and their eldest girl, worked in factories, and were

absent all day from the house: the youngest child, also a little girl,

was boarded out on the week-days at the neighbour's where the door-key

was deposited, but although busy making dirt-pies, at the entrance to

the court, when Libbie came in, she was too young to care much about her

parents' new lodger. Libbie knew that she was to sleep with the elder

girl in the front bedroom, but, as you may fancy, it seemed a liberty

even to go upstairs to take off her things, when no one was at home to

marshal the way up the ladder-like steps. So she could only take off her

bonnet, and sit down, and gaze at the now blazing fire, and think

sadly on the past, and on the lonely creature she was in this wide

world--father and mother gone, her little brother long since dead--he

would have been more than nineteen had he been alive, but she only thought of

him as the darling baby; her only friends (to call friends) living far

away at their new house; her employers, kind enough people in their way,

but too rapidly twirling round on this bustling earth to have leisure to

think of the little work-woman, excepting when they wanted gowns turned,

carpets mended, or household linen darned; and hardly even the natural

though hidden hope of a young girl's heart, to cheer her on with the

bright visions of a home of her own at some future day, where, loving

and beloved, she might fulfil a woman's dearest duties.



For Libbie was very plain, as she had known so long that the consciousness

of it had ceased to mortify her. You can hardly live in Manchester

without having some idea of your personal appearance: the factory lads

and lasses take good care of that; and if you meet them at the hours

when they are pouring out of the mills, you are sure to hear a good

number of truths, some of them combined with such a spirit of impudent

fun, that you can scarcely keep from laughing, even at the joke against

yourself. Libbie had often and often been greeted by such questions

as--""How long is it since you were a beauty?""--""What would you take a

day to stand in the fields to scare away the birds?"" &c., for her to

linger under any impression as to her looks.



While she was thus musing, and quietly crying, under the pictures her

fancy had conjured up, the Dixons came dropping in, and surprised her

with her wet cheeks and quivering lips.



She almost wished to have the stillness again that had so oppressed her

an hour ago, they talked and laughed so loudly and so much, and bustled

about so noisily over everything they did. Dixon took hold of one

iron handle of her box, and helped her to bump it upstairs, while his

daughter Anne followed to see the unpacking, and what sort of clothes

""little sewing body had gotten."" Mrs. Dixon rattled out her tea-things,

and put the kettle on, fetched home her youngest child, which added to

the commotion. Then she called Anne downstairs, and sent her for this

thing and that: eggs to put to the cream, it was so thin; ham, to give a

relish to the bread and butter; some new bread, hot, if she could get

it. Libbie heard all these orders, given at full pitch of Mrs. Dixon's

voice, and wondered at their extravagance, so different from the habits

of the place where she had last lodged. But they were fine spinners, in

the receipt of good wages; and confined all day in an atmosphere ranging

from seventy-five to eighty degrees. They had lost all natural, healthy

appetite for simple food, and, having no higher tastes, found their

greatest enjoyment in their luxurious meals.



When tea was ready, Libbie was called downstairs, with a rough but

hearty invitation, to share their meal; she sat mutely at the corner of

the tea-table, while they went on with their own conversation about

people and things she knew nothing about, till at length she ventured

to ask for a candle, to go and finish her unpacking before bedtime, as

she had to go out sewing for several succeeding days. But once in

the comparative peace of her bedroom, her energy failed her, and she

contented herself with locking her Noah's ark of a chest, and put out

her candle, and went to sit by the window, and gaze out at the bright

heavens; for ever and ever ""the blue sky, that bends over all,"" sheds

down a feeling of sympathy with the sorrowful at the solemn hours when

the ceaseless stars are seen to pace its depths.



By-and-by her eye fell down to gazing at the corresponding window to her

own, on the opposite side of the court. It was lighted, but the blind

was drawn down: upon the blind she saw, first unconsciously, the constant

weary motion of a little spectral shadow, a child's hand and arm--no

more; long, thin fingers hanging down from the wrist, while the arm

moved up and down, as if keeping time to the heavy pulses of dull pain.

She could not help hoping that sleep would soon come to still that

incessant, feeble motion: and now and then it did cease, as if the

little creature had dropped into a slumber from very weariness; but

presently the arm jerked up with the fingers clenched, as if with a

sudden start of agony. When Anne came up to bed, Libbie was still

sitting, watching the shadow, and she directly asked to whom it

belonged.



""It will be Margaret Hall's lad. Last summer, when it was so hot, there

was no biding with the window shut at night, and theirs was open too:

and many's the time he has waked me with his moans; they say he's been

better sin' cold weather came.""



""Is he always in bed? Whatten ails him?"" asked Libbie.



""Summat's amiss wi' his backbone, folks say; he's better and worse,

like. He's a nice little chap enough, and his mother's not that bad

either; only my mother and her had words, so now we don't speak.""



Libbie went on watching, and when she next spoke, to ask who and what

his mother was, Anne Dixon was fast asleep.



Time passed away, and as usual unveiled the hidden things. Libbie

found out that Margaret Hall was a widow, who earned her living as a

washerwoman; that the little suffering lad was her only child, her

dearly beloved. That while she scolded, pretty nearly, everybody else,

""till her name was up"" in the neighbourhood for a termagant, to him she

was evidently most tender and gentle. He lay alone on his little bed,

near the window, through the day, while she was away toiling for a

livelihood. But when Libbie had plain sewing to do at her lodgings,

instead of going out to sew, she used to watch from her bedroom window

for the time when the shadows opposite, by their mute gestures, told

that the mother had returned to bend over her child, to smooth his

pillow, to alter his position, to get him his nightly cup of tea. And

often in the night Libbie could not help rising gently from bed, to see

if the little arm was waving up and down, as was his accustomed habit

when sleepless from pain.



Libbie had a good deal of sewing to do at home that winter, and whenever

it was not so cold as to benumb her fingers, she took it upstairs, in

order to watch the little lad in her few odd moments of pause. On his

better days he could sit up enough to peep out of his window, and she

found he liked to look at her. Presently she ventured to nod to him

across the court; and his faint smile, and ready nod back again, showed

that this gave him pleasure. I think she would have been encouraged by

this smile to have proceeded to a speaking acquaintance, if it had not

been for his terrible mother, to whom it seemed to be irritation enough

to know that Libbie was a lodger at the Dixons' for her to talk at her

whenever they encountered each other, and to live evidently in wait for

some good opportunity of abuse.



With her constant interest in him, Libbie soon discovered his great want

of an object on which to occupy his thoughts, and which might distract

his attention, when alone through the long day, from the pain he endured.

He was very fond of flowers. It was November when she had first removed

to her lodgings, but it had been very mild weather, and a few flowers

yet lingered in the gardens, which the country people gathered into

nosegays, and brought on market-days into Manchester. His mother had

brought him a bunch of Michaelmas daisies the very day Libbie had become

a neighbour, and she watched their history. He put them first in an old

teapot, of which the spout was broken off and the lid lost; and he daily

replenished the teapot from the jug of water his mother left near him to

quench his feverish thirst. By-and-by, one or two of the constellation

of lilac stars faded, and then the time he had hitherto spent in

admiring, almost caressing them, was devoted to cutting off those

flowers whose decay marred the beauty of the nosegay. It took him half

the morning, with his feeble, languid motions, and his cumbrous old

scissors, to trim up his diminished darlings. Then at last he seemed to

think he had better preserve the few that remained by drying them; so

they were carefully put between the leaves of the old Bible; and then,

whenever a better day came, when he had strength enough to lift the

ponderous book, he used to open the pages to look at his flower friends.

In winter he could have no more living flowers to tend.



Libbie thought and thought, till at last an idea flashed upon her mind,

that often made a happy smile steal over her face as she stitched away,

and that cheered her through the solitary winter--for solitary it

continued to be, though the Dixons were very good sort of people, never

pressed her for payment, if she had had but little work to do that week;

never grudged her a share of their extravagant meals, which were far

more luxurious than she could have met with anywhere else, for her

previously agreed payment in case of working at home; and they would

fain have taught her to drink rum in her tea, assuring her that she

should have it for nothing and welcome. But they were too touchy, too

prosperous, too much absorbed in themselves, to take off Libbie's

feeling of solitariness; not half as much as the little face by day, and

the shadow by night, of him with whom she had never yet exchanged a

word.



Her idea was this: her mother came from the east of England, where, as

perhaps you know, they have the pretty custom of sending presents on St.

Valentine's day, with the donor's name unknown, and, of course, the

mystery constitutes half the enjoyment. The fourteenth of February was

Libbie's birthday too, and many a year, in the happy days of old, had

her mother delighted to surprise her with some little gift, of which

she more than half-guessed the giver, although each Valentine's day the

manner of its arrival was varied. Since then the fourteenth of February

had been the dreariest of all the year, because the most haunted by

memory of departed happiness. But now, this year, if she could not have

the old gladness of heart herself, she would try and brighten the life

of another. She would save, and she would screw, but she would buy a

canary and a cage for that poor little laddie opposite, who wore out his

monotonous life with so few pleasures, and so much pain.



I doubt I may not tell you here of the anxieties and the fears, of the

hopes and the self-sacrifices--all, perhaps small in the tangible effect

as the widow's mite, yet not the less marked by the viewless angels who

go about continually among us--which varied Libbie's life before she

accomplished her purpose. It is enough to say it was accomplished. The

very day before the fourteenth she found time to go with her half-guinea

to a barber's who lived near Albemarle Street, and who was famous for

his stock of singing-birds. There are enthusiasts about all sorts of

things, both good and bad, and many of the weavers in Manchester know

and care more about birds than any one would easily credit. Stubborn,

silent, reserved men on many things, you have only to touch on the

subject of birds to light up their faces with brightness. They will tell

you who won the prizes at the last canary show, where the prize birds

may be seen, and give you all the details of those funny, but pretty and

interesting mimicries of great people's cattle shows. Among these

amateurs, Emanuel Morris the barber was an oracle.



He took Libbie into his little back room, used for private shaving of

modest men, who did not care to be exhibited in the front shop decked

out in the full glories of lather; and which was hung round with birds

in rude wicker cages, with the exception of those who had won prizes,

and were consequently honoured with gilt-wire prisons. The longer and

thinner the body of the bird was, the more admiration it received, as

far as external beauty went; and when, in addition to this, the colour

was deep and clear, and its notes strong and varied, the more did Emanuel

dwell upon its perfections. But these were all prize birds; and, on

inquiry, Libbie heard, with some little sinking at heart, that their

price ran from one to two guineas.



""I'm not over-particular as to shape and colour,"" said she, ""I should

like a good singer, that's all!""



She dropped a little in Emanuel's estimation. However, he showed her his

good singers, but all were above Libbie's means.



""After all, I don't think I care so much about the singing very loud;

it's but a noise after all, and sometimes noise fidgets folks.""



""They must be nesh folks as is put out with the singing o' birds,""

replied Emanuel, rather affronted.



""It's for one who is poorly,"" said Libbie, deprecatingly.



""Well,"" said he, as if considering the matter, ""folk that are cranky,

often take more to them as shows 'em love, than to them as is clever

and gifted. Happen yo'd rather have this'n,"" opening a cage-door,

and calling to a dull-coloured bird, sitting moped up in a corner,

""Here--Jupiter, Jupiter!""



The bird smoothed its feathers in an instant, and, uttering a little

note of delight, flew to Emanuel, putting his beak to his lips, as if

kissing him, and then, perching on his head, it began a gurgling warble

of pleasure, not by any means so varied or so clear as the song of the

others, but which pleased Libbie more; for she was always one to find

out she liked the gooseberries that were accessible, better than the

grapes that were beyond her reach. The price too was just right, so

she gladly took possession of the cage, and hid it under her cloak,

preparatory to carrying it home. Emanuel meanwhile was giving her

directions as to its food, with all the minuteness of one loving his

subject.



""Will it soon get to know any one?"" asked she.



""Give him two days only, and you and he'll be as thick as him and me are

now. You've only to open his door, and call him, and he'll follow you

round the room; but he'll first kiss you, and then perch on your head.

He only wants larning, which I've no time to give him, to do many

another accomplishment.""



""What's his name? I did not rightly catch it.""



""Jupiter,--it's not common; but the town's o'errun with Bobbies and

Dickies, and as my birds are thought a bit out o' the way, I like to

have better names for 'em, so I just picked a few out o' my lad's school

books. It's just as ready, when you're used to it, to say Jupiter as

Dicky.""



""I could bring my tongue round to Peter better; would he answer to

Peter?"" asked Libbie, now on the point of departing.



""Happen he might; but I think he'd come readier to the three syllables.""



On Valentine's day, Jupiter's cage was decked round with ivy leaves,

making quite a pretty wreath on the wicker work; and to one of them was

pinned a slip of paper, with these words, written in Libbie's best round

hand:--



""From your faithful Valentine. Please take notice his name is Peter, and

he'll come if you call him, after a bit.""



But little work did Libbie do that afternoon, she was so engaged in

watching for the messenger who was to bear her present to her little

valentine, and run away as soon as he had delivered up the canary, and

explained to whom it was sent.



At last he came; then there was a pause before the woman of the house

was at liberty to take it upstairs. Then Libbie saw the little face

flush up into a bright colour, the feeble hands tremble with delighted

eagerness, the head bent down to try and make out the writing (beyond

his power, poor lad, to read), the rapturous turning round of the cage

in order to see the canary in every point of view, head, tail, wings,

and feet; an intention in which Jupiter, in his uneasiness at being

again among strangers, did not second, for he hopped round so, as

continually to present a full front to the boy. It was a source of never

wearying delight to the little fellow, till daylight closed in; he

evidently forgot to wonder who had sent it him, in his gladness at

his possession of such a treasure; and when the shadow of his mother

darkened on the blind, and the bird had been exhibited, Libbie saw her

do what, with all her tenderness, seemed rarely to have entered into her

thoughts--she bent down and kissed her boy, in a mother's sympathy with

the joy of her child.



The canary was placed for the night between the little bed and window;

and when Libbie rose once, to take her accustomed peep, she saw the

little arm put fondly round the cage, as if embracing his new treasure

even in his sleep. How Jupiter slept this first night is quite another

thing.



So ended the first day in Libbie's three eras in last year.





ERA II.



WHITSUNTIDE.



The brightest, fullest daylight poured down into No. 2, ---- Court,

Albemarle Street, and the heat, even at the early hour of five, as at

the noontide on the June days of many years past.



The court seemed alive, and merry with voices and laughter. The bedroom

windows were open wide, and had been so all night, on account of

the heat; and every now and then you might see a head and a pair of

shoulders, simply encased in shirt sleeves, popped out, and you might

hear the inquiry passed from one to the other,--""Well, Jack, and where

art thee bound for?""



""Dunham!""



""Why, what an old-fashioned chap thou be'st. Thy grandad afore thee went

to Dunham: but thou wert always a slow coach. I'm off to Alderley,--me

and my missis.""



""Ay, that's because there's only thee and thy missis. Wait till thou

hast gotten four childer, like me, and thou'lt be glad enough to take

'em to Dunham, oud-fashioned way, for fourpence apiece.""



""I'd still go to Alderley; I'd not be bothered with my children; they

should keep house at home.""



A pair of hands, the person to whom they belonged invisible, boxed his

ears on this last speech, in a very spirited, though playful, manner,

and the neighbours all laughed at the surprised look of the speaker, at

this assault from an unseen foe. The man who had been holding

conversation with him cried out,--



""Sarved him right, Mrs. Slater: he knows nought about it yet; but

when he gets them he'll be as loth to leave the babbies at home on a

Whitsuntide as any on us. We shall live to see him in Dunham Park yet,

wi' twins in his arms, and another pair on 'em clutching at daddy's

coat-tails, let alone your share of youngsters, missis.""



At this moment our friend Libbie appeared at her window, and Mrs.

Slater, who had taken her discomfited husband's place, called out,--



""Elizabeth Marsh, where are Dixons and you bound to?""



""Dixons are not up yet; he said last night he'd take his holiday out in

lying in bed. I'm going to the old-fashioned place, Dunham.""



""Thou art never going by thyself, moping!""



""No. I'm going with Margaret Hall and her lad,"" replied Libbie, hastily

withdrawing from the window, in order to avoid hearing any remarks on

the associates she had chosen for her day of pleasure--the scold of the

neighbourhood, and her sickly, ailing child!



But Jupiter might have been a dove, and his ivy leaves an olive branch,

for the peace he had brought, the happiness he had caused, to three

individuals at least. For of course it could not long be a mystery who

had sent little Frank Hall his valentine; nor could his mother long

entertain her hard manner towards one who had given her child a new

pleasure. She was shy, and she was proud, and for some time she struggled

against the natural desire of manifesting her gratitude; but one evening,

when Libbie was returning home, with a bundle of work half as large as

herself, as she dragged herself along through the heated streets, she

was overtaken by Margaret Hall, her burden gently pulled from her, and

her way home shortened, and her weary spirits soothed and cheered, by

the outpourings of Margaret's heart; for the barrier of reserve once

broken down, she had much to say, to thank her for days of amusement and

happy employment for her lad, to speak of his gratitude, to tell of her

hopes and fears,--the hopes and fears that made up the dates of her

life. From that time, Libbie lost her awe of the termagant in interest

for the mother, whose all was ventured in so frail a bark. From this

time, Libbie was a fast friend with both mother and son, planning

mitigations for the sorrowful days of the latter as eagerly as poor

Margaret Hall, and with far more success. His life had flickered up

under the charm and excitement of the last few months. He even seemed

strong enough to undertake the journey to Dunham, which Libbie had

arranged as a Whitsuntide treat, and for which she and his mother had

been hoarding up for several weeks. The canal boat left Knott-mill at

six, and it was now past five; so Libbie let herself out very gently,

and went across to her friends. She knocked at the door of their

lodging-room, and, without waiting for an answer, entered.



Franky's face was flushed, and he was trembling with excitement,--partly

with pleasure, but partly with some eager wish not yet granted.



""He wants sore to take Peter with him,"" said his mother to Libbie, as if

referring the matter to her. The boy looked imploringly at her.



""He would like it, I know; for one thing, he'd miss me sadly, and

chirrup for me all day long, he'd be so lonely. I could not be half so

happy a-thinking on him, left alone here by himself. Then, Libbie, he's

just like a Christian, so fond of flowers and green leaves, and them

sort of things. He chirrups to me so when mother brings me a pennyworth

of wall-flowers to put round his cage. He would talk if he could, you

know; but I can tell what he means quite as one as if he spoke. Do let

Peter go, Libbie; I'll carry him in my own arms.""



So Jupiter was allowed to be of the party. Now Libbie had overcome the

great difficulty of conveying Franky to the boat, by offering to ""slay""

for a coach, and the shouts and exclamations of the neighbours told

them that their conveyance awaited them at the bottom of the court. His

mother carried Franky, light in weight, though heavy in helplessness,

and he would hold the cage, believing that he was thus redeeming his

pledge, that Peter should be a trouble to no one. Libbie proceeded to

arrange the bundle containing their dinner, as a support in the corner

of the coach. The neighbours came out with many blunt speeches, and more

kindly wishes, and one or two of them would have relieved Margaret of

her burden, if she would have allowed it. The presence of that little

crippled fellow seemed to obliterate all the angry feelings which had

existed between his mother and her neighbours, and which had formed the

politics of that little court for many a day.



And now they were fairly off! Franky bit his lips in attempted endurance

of the pain the motion caused him; he winced and shrank, until they

were fairly on a Macadamized thoroughfare, when he closed his eyes, and

seemed desirous of a few minutes' rest. Libbie felt very shy, and very

much afraid of being seen by her employers, ""set up in a coach!"" and

so she hid herself in a corner, and made herself as small as possible;

while Mrs. Hall had exactly the opposite feeling, and was delighted to

stand up, stretching out of the window, and nodding to pretty nearly

every one they met or passed on the foot-paths; and they were not a few,

for the streets were quite gay, even at that early hour, with parties

going to this or that railway station, or to the boats which crowded the

canals on this bright holiday week; and almost every one they met seemed

to enter into Mrs. Hall's exhilaration of feeling, and had a smile or

nod in return. At last she plumped down by Libbie, and exclaimed, ""I

never was in a coach but once afore, and that was when I was a-going to

be married. It's like heaven; and all done over with such beautiful

gimp, too!"" continued she, admiring the lining of the vehicle. Jupiter

did not enjoy it so much.



As if the holiday time, the lovely weather, and the ""sweet hour of

prime"" had a genial influence, as no doubt they have, everybody's heart

seemed softened towards poor Franky. The driver lifted him out with the

tenderness of strength, and bore him carefully down to the boat; the

people then made way, and gave him the best seat in their power,--or

rather I should call it a couch, for they saw he was weary, and insisted

on his lying down,--an attitude he would have been ashamed to assume

without the protection of his mother and Libbie, who now appeared,

bearing their baskets and carrying Peter.



Away the boat went, to make room for others, for every conveyance,

both by land and water, is in requisition in Whitsun-week, to give

the hard-worked crowds the opportunity of enjoying the charms of the

country. Even every standing-place in the canal packets was occupied,

and as they glided along, the banks were lined with people, who seemed

to find it object enough to watch the boats go by, packed close and full

with happy beings brimming with anticipations of a day's pleasure. The

country through which they passed is as uninteresting as can well be

imagined; but still it is the country: and the screams of delight from

the children, and the low laughs of pleasure from the parents, at every

blossoming tree that trailed its wreath against some cottage wall, or

at the tufts of late primroses which lingered in the cool depths of

grass along the canal banks, the thorough relish of everything, as

if dreading to let the least circumstance of this happy day pass over

without its due appreciation, made the time seem all too short, although

it took two hours to arrive at a place only eight miles from Manchester.

Even Franky, with all his impatience to see Dunham woods (which I think

he confused with London, believing both to be paved with gold), enjoyed

the easy motion of the boat so much, floating along, while pictures

moved before him, that he regretted when the time came for landing among

the soft, green meadows, that came sloping down to the dancing water's

brim. His fellow-passengers carried him to the park, and refused all

payment, although his mother had laid by sixpence on purpose, as a

recompense for this service.



""Oh, Libbie, how beautiful! Oh, mother, mother! is the whole world out

of Manchester as beautiful as this? I did not know trees were like this!

Such green homes for birds! Look, Peter! would not you like to be there,

up among those boughs? But I can't let you go, you know, because you're

my little bird brother, and I should be quite lost without you.""



They spread a shawl upon the fine mossy turf, at the root of a

beech-tree, which made a sort of natural couch, and there they laid him,

and bade him rest, in spite of the delight which made him believe

himself capable of any exertion. Where he lay,--always holding Jupiter's

cage, and often talking to him as to a playfellow,--he was on the verge

of a green area, shut in by magnificent trees, in all the glory of their

early foliage, before the summer heats had deepened their verdure into

one rich, monotonous tint. And hither came party after party; old men

and maidens, young men and children,--whole families trooped along after

the guiding fathers, who bore the youngest in their arms, or astride

upon their backs, while they turned round occasionally to the wives,

with whom they shared some fond local remembrance. For years has Dunham

Park been the favourite resort of the Manchester work-people; for more

years than I can tell; probably ever since ""the Duke,"" by his canals,

opened out the system of cheap travelling. Its scenery, too, which

presents such a complete contrast to the whirl and turmoil of Manchester;

so thoroughly woodland, with its ancestral trees (here and there

lightning blanched); its ""verdurous walls;"" its grassy walks, leading

far away into some glade, where you start at the rabbit rustling among

the last year's fern, and where the wood-pigeon's call seems the only

fitting and accordant sound. Depend upon it, this complete sylvan

repose, this accessible quiet, this lapping the soul in green images of

the country, forms the most complete contrast to a town's-person, and

consequently has over such the greatest power to charm.



Presently Libbie found out she was very hungry. Now they were but

provided with dinner, which was, of course, to be eaten as near twelve

o'clock as might be; and Margaret Hall, in her prudence, asked a

working-man near to tell her what o'clock it was.



""Nay,"" said he, ""I'll ne'er look at clock or watch to-day. I'll not

spoil my pleasure by finding out how fast it's going away. If thou'rt

hungry, eat. I make my own dinner hour, and I have eaten mine an hour

ago.""



So they had their veal pies, and then found out it was only about

half-past ten o'clock; by so many pleasurable events had that morning

been marked. But such was their buoyancy of spirits, that they only

enjoyed their mistake, and joined in the general laugh against the man

who had eaten his dinner somewhere about nine. He laughed most heartily

of all, till, suddenly stopping, he said,--



""I must not go on at this rate; laughing gives one such an appetite.""



""Oh! if that's all,"" said a merry-looking man, lying at full length, and

brushing the fresh scent out of the grass, while two or three little

children tumbled over him, and crept about him, as kittens or puppies

frolic with their parents, ""if that's all, we'll have a subscription of

eatables for them improvident folk as have eaten their dinner for their

breakfast. Here's a sausage pasty and a handful of nuts for my share.

Bring round a hat, Bob, and see what the company will give.""



Bob carried out the joke, much to little Franky's amusement; and no one

was so churlish as to refuse, although the contributions varied from a

peppermint drop up to a veal pie and a sausage pasty.



""It's a thriving trade,"" said Bob, as he emptied his hatful of

provisions on the grass by Libbie's side. ""Besides, it's tiptop, too, to

live on the public. Hark! what is that?""



The laughter and the chat were suddenly hushed, and mothers told their

little ones to listen,--as, far away in the distance, now sinking and

falling, now swelling and clear, came a ringing peal of children's

voices, blended together in one of those psalm tunes which we are all

of us familiar with, and which bring to mind the old, old days, when we,

as wondering children, were first led to worship ""Our Father,"" by those

beloved ones who have since gone to the more perfect worship. Holy was

that distant choral praise, even to the most thoughtless; and when it,

in fact, was ended, in the instant's pause, during which the ear awaits

the repetition of the air, they caught the noontide hum and buzz of the

myriads of insects who danced away their lives in the glorious day; they

heard the swaying of the mighty woods in the soft but resistless breeze,

and then again once more burst forth the merry jests and the shouts of

childhood; and again the elder ones resumed their happy talk, as they

lay or sat ""under the greenwood tree."" Fresh parties came dropping in;

some laden with wild flowers--almost with branches of hawthorn, indeed;

while one or two had made prizes of the earliest dog-roses, and had cast

away campion, stitchwort, ragged robin, all to keep the lady of the

hedges from being obscured or hidden by the community.



One after another drew near to Franky, and looked on with interest as he

lay sorting the flowers given to him. Happy parents stood by, with their

household bands around them, in health and comeliness, and felt the

sad prophecy of those shrivelled limbs, those wasted fingers, those

lamp-like eyes, with their bright, dark lustre. His mother was too

eagerly watching his happiness to read the meaning of those grave looks,

but Libbie saw them and understood them; and a chill shudder went

through her, even on that day, as she thought on the future.



""Ay! I thought we should give you a start!""



A start they did give, with their terrible slap on Libbie's back, as she

sat idly grouping flowers, and following out her sorrowful thoughts. It

was the Dixons. Instead of keeping their holiday by lying in bed, they

and their children had roused themselves, and had come by the omnibus to

the nearest point. For an instant the meeting was an awkward one, on

account of the feud between Margaret Hall and Mrs. Dixon, but there was

no long resisting of kindly mother Nature's soothings, at that holiday

time, and in that lonely tranquil spot; or if they could have been

unheeded, the sight of Franky would have awed every angry feeling

into rest, so changed was he since the Dixons had last seen him; and

since he had been the Puck or Robin Goodfellow of the neighbourhood,

whose marbles were always rolling under other people's feet, and whose

top-strings were always hanging in nooses to catch the unwary. Yes, he,

the feeble, mild, almost girlish-looking lad, had once been a merry,

happy rogue, and as such often cuffed by Mrs. Dixon, the very Mrs. Dixon

who now stood gazing with the tears in her eyes. Could she, in sight of

him, the changed, the fading, keep up a quarrel with his mother?



""How long hast thou been here?"" asked Dixon.



""Welly on for all day,"" answered Libbie.



""Hast never been to see the deer, or the king and queen oaks? Lord, how

stupid.""



His wife pinched his arm, to remind him of Franky's helpless condition,

which of course tethered the otherwise willing feet. But Dixon had a

remedy. He called Bob, and one or two others, and each taking a corner

of the strong plaid shawl, they slung Franky as in a hammock, and thus

carried him merrily along, down the wood paths, over the smooth, grassy

turf, while the glimmering shine and shadow fell on his upturned face.

The women walked behind, talking, loitering along, always in sight of

the hammock; now picking up some green treasure from the ground, now

catching at the low hanging branches of the horse-chestnut. The soul

grew much on this day, and in these woods, and all unconsciously, as

souls do grow. They followed Franky's hammock-bearers up a grassy knoll,

on the top of which stood a group of pine trees, whose stems looked like

dark red gold in the sunbeams. They had taken Franky there to show him

Manchester, far away in the blue plain, against which the woodland

foreground cut with a soft clear line. Far, far away in the distance on

that flat plain, you might see the motionless cloud of smoke hanging

over a great town, and that was Manchester,--ugly, smoky Manchester,

dear, busy, earnest, noble-working Manchester; where their children had

been born, and where, perhaps, some lay buried; where their homes were,

and where God had cast their lives, and told them to work out their

destiny.



""Hurrah! for oud smoke-jack!"" cried Bob, putting Franky softly down on

the grass, before he whirled his hat round, preparatory to a shout.

""Hurrah! hurrah!"" from all the men. ""There's the rim of my hat lying

like a quoit yonder,"" observed Bob quietly, as he replaced his brimless

hat on his head with the gravity of a judge.



""Here's the Sunday-school children a-coming to sit on this shady side,

and have their buns and milk. Hark! they're singing the infant-school

grace.""



They sat close at hand, so that Franky could hear the words they sang,

in rings of children, making, in their gay summer prints, newly donned

for that week, garlands of little faces, all happy and bright upon that

green hill-side. One little ""Dot"" of a girl came shily behind Franky,

whom she had long been watching, and threw her half-bun at his side, and

then ran away and hid herself, in very shame at the boldness of her own

sweet impulse. She kept peeping from her screen at Franky all the time;

and he meanwhile was almost too much pleased and happy to eat; the world

was so beautiful, and men, women, and children all so tender and kind;

so softened, in fact, by the beauty of this earth, so unconsciously

touched by the spirit of love, which was the Creator of this lovely

earth. But the day drew to an end; the heat declined; the birds once

more began their warblings; the fresh scents again hung about plant,

and tree, and grass, betokening the fragrant presence of the reviving

dew, and--the boat time was near. As they trod the meadow-path once

more, they were joined by many a party they had encountered during

the day, all abounding in happiness, all full of the day's adventures.

Long-cherished quarrels had been forgotten, new friendships formed.

Fresh tastes and higher delights had been imparted that day. We have all

of us our look, now and then, called up by some noble or loving thought

(our highest on earth), which will be our likeness in heaven. I can

catch the glance on many a face, the glancing light of the cloud of

glory from heaven, ""which is our home."" That look was present on many a

hard-worked, wrinkled countenance, as they turned backwards to catch a

longing, lingering look at Dunham woods, fast deepening into blackness

of night, but whose memory was to haunt, in greenness and freshness,

many a loom, and workshop, and factory, with images of peace and beauty.



That night, as Libbie lay awake, revolving the incidents of the day, she

caught Franky's voice through the open windows. Instead of the frequent

moan of pain, he was trying to recall the burden of one of the

children's hymns,--



  Here we suffer grief and pain,

  Here we meet to part again;

    In Heaven we part no more.

          Oh! that will be joyful, &c.



She recalled his question, the whispered question, to her, in the

happiest part of the day. He asked Libbie, ""Is Dunham like heaven? the

people here are as kind as angels, and I don't want heaven to be more

beautiful than this place. If you and mother would but die with me, I

should like to die, and live always there!"" She had checked him, for

she feared he was impious; but now the young child's craving for some

definite idea of the land to which his inner wisdom told him he was

hastening, had nothing in it wrong, or even sorrowful, for--



  In Heaven we part no more.





ERA III.



MICHAELMAS.



The church clocks had struck three; the crowds of gentlemen returning to

business, after their early dinners, had disappeared within offices and

warehouses; the streets were clear and quiet, and ladies were venturing

to sally forth for their afternoon shoppings and their afternoon calls.



Slowly, slowly, along the streets, elbowed by life at every turn, a

little funeral wound its quiet way. Four men bore along a child's

coffin; two women with bowed heads followed meekly.



I need not tell you whose coffin it was, or who were those two

mourners. All was now over with little Frank Hall: his romps, his games,

his sickening, his suffering, his death. All was now over, but the

Resurrection and the Life.



His mother walked as in a stupor. Could it be that he was dead! If he

had been less of an object of her thoughts, less of a motive for her

labours, she could sooner have realized it. As it was, she followed

his poor, cast-off, worn-out body as if she were borne along by some

oppressive dream. If he were really dead, how could she be still alive?



Libbie's mind was far less stunned, and consequently far more active,

than Margaret Hall's. Visions, as in a phantasmagoria, came rapidly

passing before her--recollections of the time (which seemed now so

long ago) when the shadow of the feebly-waving arm first caught her

attention; of the bright, strangely isolated day at Dunham Park, where

the world had seemed so full of enjoyment, and beauty, and life; of

the long-continued heat, through which poor Franky had panted away his

strength in the little close room, where there was no escaping the hot

rays of the afternoon sun; of the long nights when his mother and she

had watched by his side, as he moaned continually, whether awake or

asleep; of the fevered moaning slumber of exhaustion; of the pitiful

little self-upbraidings for his own impatience of suffering, only

impatient in his own eyes--most true and holy patience in the sight

of others; and then the fading away of life, the loss of power, the

increased unconsciousness, the lovely look of angelic peace, which

followed the dark shadow on the countenance, where was he--what was he

now?



And so they laid him in his grave, and heard the solemn funeral words;

but far off in the distance, as if not addressed to them.



Margaret Hall bent over the grave to catch one last glance--she had

not spoken, nor sobbed, nor done aught but shiver now and then, since

the morning; but now her weight bore more heavily on Libbie's arm,

and without sigh or sound she fell an unconscious heap on the piled-up

gravel. They helped Libbie to bring her round; but long after her

half-opened eyes and altered breathing showed that her senses were

restored, she lay, speechless and motionless, without attempting to rise

from her strange bed, as if the earth contained nothing worth even that

trifling exertion.



At last Libbie and she left that holy, consecrated spot, and bent

their steps back to the only place more consecrated still; where he had

rendered up his spirit; and where memories of him haunted each common,

rude piece of furniture that their eyes fell upon. As the woman of the

house opened the door, she pulled Libbie on one side, and said--



""Anne Dixon has been across to see you; she wants to have a word with

you.""



""I cannot go now,"" replied Libbie, as she pushed hastily along, in order

to enter the room (_his_ room), at the same time with the childless

mother: for, as she had anticipated, the sight of that empty spot, the

glance at the uncurtained open window, letting in the fresh air, and the

broad, rejoicing light of day, where all had so long been darkened and

subdued, unlocked the waters of the fountain, and long and shrill were

the cries for her boy that the poor woman uttered.



""Oh! dear Mrs. Hall,"" said Libbie, herself drenched in tears, ""do not

take on so badly; I'm sure it would grieve _him_ sore if he were alive,

and you know he is--Bible tells us so; and may be he's here watching how

we go on without him, and hoping we don't fret over much.""



Mrs. Hall's sobs grew worse and more hysterical.



""Oh! listen,"" said Libbie, once more struggling against her own increasing

agitation. ""Listen! there's Peter chirping as he always does when he's

put about, frightened like; and you know he that's gone could never

abide to hear the canary chirp in that shrill way.""



Margaret Hall did check herself, and curb her expressions of agony,

in order not to frighten the little creature he had loved; and as her

outward grief subsided, Libbie took up the large old Bible, which fell

open at the never-failing comfort of the fourteenth chapter of St.

John's Gospel.



How often these large family Bibles do open at that chapter! as if,

unused in more joyous and prosperous times, the soul went home to its

words of loving sympathy when weary and sorrowful, just as the little

child seeks the tender comfort of its mother in all its griefs and

cares.



And Margaret put back her wet, ruffled, grey hair from her heated,

tear-stained, woeful face, and listened with such earnest eyes, trying

to form some idea of the ""Father's house,"" where her boy had gone to

dwell.



They were interrupted by a low tap at the door. Libbie went. ""Anne Dixon

has watched you home, and wants to have a word with you,"" said the woman

of the house, in a whisper. Libbie went back and closed the book, with a

word of explanation to Margaret Hall, and then ran downstairs, to learn

the reason of Anne's anxiety to see her.



""Oh, Libbie!"" she burst out with, and then, checking herself with the

remembrance of Libbie's last solemn duty, ""how's Margaret Hall? But,

of course, poor thing, she'll fret a bit at first; she'll be some time

coming round, mother says, seeing it's as well that poor lad is taken;

for he'd always ha' been a cripple, and a trouble to her--he was a fine

lad once, too.""



She had come full of another and a different subject; but the sight of

Libbie's sad, weeping face, and the quiet, subdued tone of her manner,

made her feel it awkward to begin on any other theme than the one which

filled up her companion's mind. To her last speech Libbie answered

sorrowfully--



""No doubt, Anne, it's ordered for the best; but oh! don't call him,

don't think he could ever ha' been, a trouble to his mother, though he

were a cripple. She loved him all the more for each thing she had to do

for him--I am sure I did."" Libbie cried a little behind her apron. Anne

Dixon felt still more awkward in introducing the discordant subject.



""Well! 'flesh is grass,' Bible says,"" and having fulfilled the etiquette

of quoting a text if possible, if not of making a moral observation on

the fleeting nature of earthly things, she thought she was at liberty to

pass on to her real errand.



""You must not go on moping yourself, Libbie Marsh. What I wanted special

for to see you this afternoon, was to tell you, you must come to my

wedding to-morrow. Nanny Dawson has fallen sick, and there's none as I

should like to have bridesmaid in her place as well as you.""



""To-morrow! Oh, I cannot!--indeed I cannot!""



""Why not?""



Libbie did not answer, and Anne Dixon grew impatient.



""Surely, in the name o' goodness, you're never going to baulk yourself

of a day's pleasure for the sake of yon little cripple that's dead and

gone!""



""No,--it's not baulking myself of--don't be angry, Anne Dixon, with him,

please; but I don't think it would be a pleasure to me,--I don't feel as

if I could enjoy it; thank you all the same. But I did love that little

lad very dearly--I did,"" sobbing a little, ""and I can't forget him and

make merry so soon.""



""Well--I never!"" exclaimed Anne, almost angrily.



""Indeed, Anne, I feel your kindness, and you and Bob have my best

wishes,--that's what you have; but even if I went, I should be thinking

all day of him, and of his poor, poor mother, and they say it's bad to

think very much on them that's dead, at a wedding.""



""Nonsense,"" said Anne, ""I'll take the risk of the ill-luck. After all,

what is marrying? Just a spree, Bob says. He often says he does not

think I shall make him a good wife, for I know nought about house

matters, wi' working in a factory; but he says he'd rather be uneasy wi'

me than easy wi' anybody else. There's love for you! And I tell him I'd

rather have him tipsy than any one else sober.""



""Oh! Anne Dixon, hush! you don't know yet what it is to have a drunken

husband. I have seen something of it: father used to get fuddled, and,

in the long run, it killed mother, let alone--oh! Anne, God above only

knows what the wife of a drunken man has to bear. Don't tell,"" said she,

lowering her voice, ""but father killed our little baby in one of his

bouts; mother never looked up again, nor father either, for that matter,

only his was in a different way. Mother will have gotten to little

Jemmie now, and they'll be so happy together,--and perhaps Franky too.

Oh!"" said she, recovering herself from her train of thought, ""never say

aught lightly of the wife's lot whose husband is given to drink!""



""Dear, what a preachment. I tell you what, Libbie, you're as born an

old maid as ever I saw. You'll never be married to either drunken or

sober.""



Libbie's face went rather red, but without losing its meek expression.



""I know that as well as you can tell me; and more reason, therefore, as

God has seen fit to keep me out of woman's natural work, I should try

and find work for myself. I mean,"" seeing Anne Dixon's puzzled look,

""that as I know I'm never likely to have a home of my own, or a husband

that would look to me to make all straight, or children to watch over or

care for, all which I take to be woman's natural work, I must not lose

time in fretting and fidgetting after marriage, but just look about me

for somewhat else to do. I can see many a one misses it in this. They

will hanker after what is ne'er likely to be theirs, instead of facing

it out, and settling down to be old maids; and, as old maids, just

looking round for the odd jobs God leaves in the world for such as old

maids to do. There's plenty of such work, and there's the blessing of

God on them as does it."" Libbie was almost out of breath at this

outpouring of what had long been her inner thoughts.



""That's all very true, I make no doubt, for them as is to be old maids;

but as I'm not, please God to-morrow comes, you might have spared your

breath to cool your porridge. What I want to know is, whether you'll be

bridesmaid to-morrow or not. Come, now do; it will do you good, after

all your working, and watching, and slaving yourself for that poor

Franky Hall.""



""It was one of my odd jobs,"" said Libbie, smiling, though her eyes were

brimming over with tears; ""but, dear Anne,"" said she, recovering

itself, ""I could not do it to-morrow, indeed I could not.""



""And I can't wait,"" said Anne Dixon, almost sulkily, ""Bob and I put it

off from to-day, because of the funeral, and Bob had set his heart on

its being on Michaelmas-day; and mother says the goose won't keep beyond

to-morrow. Do come: father finds eatables, and Bob finds drink, and we

shall be so jolly! and after we've been to church, we're to walk round

the town in pairs, white satin ribbon in our bonnets, and refreshments

at any public-house we like, Bob says. And after dinner there's to be a

dance. Don't be a fool; you can do no good by staying. Margaret Hall

will have to go out washing, I'll be bound.""



""Yes, she must go to Mrs. Wilkinson's, and, for that matter, I must go

working too. Mrs. Williams has been after me to make her girl's winter

things ready; only I could not leave Franky, he clung so to me.""



""Then you won't be bridesmaid! is that your last word?""



""It is; you must not be angry with me, Anne Dixon,"" said Libbie,

deprecatingly.



But Anne was gone without a reply.



With a heavy heart Libbie mounted the little staircase, for she felt

how ungracious her refusal of Anne's kindness must appear, to one who

understood so little the feelings which rendered her acceptance of it a

moral impossibility.



On opening the door she saw Margaret Hall, with the Bible open on the

table before her. For she had puzzled out the place where Libbie was

reading, and, with her finger under the line, was spelling out the words

of consolation, piecing the syllables together aloud, with the earnest

anxiety of comprehension with which a child first learns to read. So

Libbie took the stool by her side, before she was aware that any one had

entered the room.



""What did she want you for?"" asked Margaret. ""But I can guess; she

wanted you to be at th' wedding that is to come off this week, they say.

Ay, they'll marry, and laugh, and dance, all as one as if my boy was

alive,"" said she, bitterly. ""Well, he was neither kith nor kin of yours,

so I maun try and be thankful for what you've done for him, and not

wonder at your forgetting him afore he's well settled in his grave.""



""I never can forget him, and I'm not going to the wedding,"" said Libbie,

quietly, for she understood the mother's jealousy of her dead child's

claims.



""I must go work at Mrs. Williams' to-morrow,"" she said, in explanation,

for she was unwilling to boast of her tender, fond regret, which had

been her principal motive for declining Anne's invitation.



""And I mun go washing, just as if nothing had happened,"" sighed forth

Mrs. Hall, ""and I mun come home at night, and find his place empty, and

all still where I used to be sure of hearing his voice ere ever I got

up the stair: no one will ever call me mother again."" She fell crying

pitifully, and Libbie could not speak for her own emotion for some time.

But during this silence she put the keystone in the arch of thoughts she

had been building up for many days; and when Margaret was again calm in

her sorrow, Libbie said, ""Mrs. Hall, I should like--would you like me to

come for to live here altogether?""



Margaret Hall looked up with a sudden light in her countenance, which

encouraged Libbie to go on.



""I could sleep with you, and pay half, you know; and we should be together

in the evenings; and her as was home first would watch for the other,

and"" (dropping her voice) ""we could talk of him at nights, you know.""



She was going on, but Mrs. Hall interrupted her.



""Oh, Libbie Marsh! and can you really think of coming to live wi' me. I

should like it above--but no! it must not be; you've no notion on what a

creature I am, at times; more like a mad one when I'm in a rage, and I

cannot keep it down. I seem to get out of bed wrong side in the morning,

and I must have my passion out with the first person I meet. Why, Libbie,""

said she, with a doleful look of agony on her face, ""I even used to fly

out on him, poor sick lad as he was, and you may judge how little you

can keep it down frae that. No, you must not come. I must live alone

now,"" sinking her voice into the low tones of despair.



But Libbie's resolution was brave and strong. ""I'm not afraid,"" said

she, smiling. ""I know you better than you know yourself, Mrs. Hall. I've

seen you try of late to keep it down, when you've been boiling over, and

I think you'll go on a-doing so. And at any rate, when you've had your

fit out, you're very kind, and I can forget if you've been a bit put

out. But I'll try not to put you out. Do let me come: I think _he_ would

like us to keep together. I'll do my very best to make you comfortable.""



""It's me! it's me as will be making your life miserable with my temper;

or else, God knows, how my heart clings to you. You and me is folk

alone in the world, for we both loved one who is dead, and who had none

else to love him. If you will live with me, Libbie, I'll try as I never

did afore to be gentle and quiet-tempered. Oh! will you try me, Libbie

Marsh?"" So out of the little grave there sprang a hope and a resolution,

which made life an object to each of the two.





When Elizabeth Marsh returned home the next evening from her day's

labours, Anne (Dixon no longer) crossed over, all in her bridal finery,

to endeavour to induce her to join the dance going on in her father's

house.



""Dear Anne, this is good of you, a-thinking of me to-night,"" said

Libbie, kissing her, ""and though I cannot come,--I've promised Mrs. Hall

to be with her,--I shall think on you, and I trust you'll be happy. I

have got a little needle-case I have looked out for you; stay, here it

is,--I wish it were more--only----""



""Only, I know what. You've been a-spending all your money in nice

things for poor Franky. Thou'rt a real good un, Libbie, and I'll keep

your needle-book to my dying day, that I will."" Seeing Anne in such a

friendly mood, emboldened Libbie to tell her of her change of place; of

her intention of lodging henceforward with Margaret Hall.



""Thou never will! Why father and mother are as fond of thee as can be;

they'll lower thy rent if that's what it is--and thou knowst they never

grudge thee bit or drop. And Margaret Hall, of all folk, to lodge wi'!

She's such a Tartar! Sooner than not have a quarrel, she'd fight right

hand against left. Thou'lt have no peace of thy life. What on earth can

make you think of such a thing, Libbie Marsh?""



""She'll be so lonely without me,"" pleaded Libbie. ""I'm sure I could make

her happier, even if she did scold me a bit now and then, than she'd be

a living alone, and I'm not afraid of her; and I mean to do my best not

to vex her: and it will ease her heart, maybe, to talk to me at times

about Franky. I shall often see your father and mother, and I shall

always thank them for their kindness to me. But they have you and little

Mary, and poor Mrs. Hall has no one.""



Anne could only repeat, ""Well, I never!"" and hurry off to tell the news

at home.



But Libbie was right. Margaret Hall is a different woman to the scold

of the neighbourhood she once was; touched and softened by the two

purifying angels, Sorrow and Love. And it is beautiful to see her

affection, her reverence, for Libbie Marsh. Her dead mother could hardly

have cared for her more tenderly than does the hard-hearted washerwoman,

not long ago so fierce and unwomanly. Libbie, herself, has such peace

shining on her countenance, as almost makes it beautiful, as she tenders

the services of a daughter to Franky's mother, no longer the desolate

lonely orphan, a stranger on the earth.





Do you ever read the moral, concluding sentence of a story? I never do,

but I once (in the year 1811, I think) heard of a deaf old lady, living

by herself, who did; and as she may have left some descendants with

the same amiable peculiarity, I will put in, for their benefit, what I

believe to be the secret of Libbie's peace of mind, the real reason why

she no longer feels oppressed at her own loneliness in the world,--





She has a purpose in life; and that purpose is a holy one.









CHRISTMAS STORMS AND SUNSHINE.





In the town of ---- (no matter where) there circulated two local

newspapers (no matter when). Now the _Flying Post_ was long established

and respectable--alias bigoted and Tory; the _Examiner_ was spirited

and intelligent--alias new-fangled and democratic. Every week these

newspapers contained articles abusing each other; as cross and peppery

as articles could be, and evidently the production of irritated minds,

although they seemed to have one stereotyped commencement,--""Though

the article appearing in last week's _Post_ (or _Examiner_) is below

contempt, yet we have been induced,"" &c., &c., and every Saturday the

Radical shopkeepers shook hands together, and agreed that the _Post_ was

done for, by the slashing, clever _Examiner_; while the more dignified

Tories began by regretting that Johnson should think that low paper,

only read by a few of the vulgar, worth wasting his wit upon; however

the _Examiner_ was at its last gasp.



It was not though. It lived and flourished; at least it paid its way, as

one of the heroes of my story could tell. He was chief compositor, or

whatever title may be given to the head-man of the mechanical part of a

newspaper. He hardly confined himself to that department. Once or twice,

unknown to the editor, when the manuscript had fallen short, he had

filled up the vacant space by compositions of his own; announcements of

a forthcoming crop of green peas in December; a grey thrush having been

seen, or a white hare, or such interesting phenomena; invented for the

occasion, I must confess; but what of that? His wife always knew when to

expect a little specimen of her husband's literary talent by a peculiar

cough, which served as prelude; and, judging from this encouraging sign,

and the high-pitched and emphatic voice in which he read them, she was

inclined to think, that an ""Ode to an early Rose-bud,"" in the corner

devoted to original poetry, and a letter in the correspondence department,

signed ""Pro Bono Publico,"" were her husband's writing, and to hold up

her head accordingly.



I never could find out what it was that occasioned the Hodgsons to lodge

in the same house as the Jenkinses. Jenkins held the same office in

the Tory paper as Hodgson did in the _Examiner_, and, as I said before,

I leave you to give it a name. But Jenkins had a proper sense of his

position, and a proper reverence for all in authority, from the king

down to the editor and sub-editor. He would as soon have thought of

borrowing the king's crown for a nightcap, or the king's sceptre for a

walking-stick, as he would have thought of filling up any spare corner

with any production of his own; and I think it would have even added

to his contempt of Hodgson (if that were possible), had he known of

the ""productions of his brain,"" as the latter fondly alluded to the

paragraphs he inserted, when speaking to his wife.



Jenkins had his wife too. Wives were wanting to finish the completeness

of the quarrel, which existed one memorable Christmas week, some dozen

years ago, between the two neighbours, the two compositors. And with

wives, it was a very pretty, a very complete quarrel. To make the

opposing parties still more equal, still more well-matched, if the

Hodgsons had a baby (""such a baby!--a poor, puny little thing""), Mrs.

Jenkins had a cat (""such a cat! a great, nasty, miowling tom-cat, that

was always stealing the milk put by for little Angel's supper""). And

now, having matched Greek with Greek, I must proceed to the tug of war.

It was the day before Christmas; such a cold east wind! such an inky

sky! such a blue-black look in people's faces, as they were driven out

more than usual, to complete their purchases for the next day's

festival.



Before leaving home that morning, Jenkins had given some money to his

wife to buy the next day's dinner.



""My dear, I wish for turkey and sausages. It may be a weakness, but I

own I am partial to sausages. My deceased mother was. Such tastes are

hereditary. As to the sweets--whether plum-pudding or mince-pies--I

leave such considerations to you; I only beg you not to mind expense.

Christmas comes but once a year.""



And again he had called out from the bottom of the first flight of

stairs, just close to the Hodgsons' door (""such ostentatiousness,"" as

Mrs. Hodgson observed), ""You will not forget the sausages, my dear?""



""I should have liked to have had something above common, Mary,"" said

Hodgson, as they too made their plans for the next day, ""but I think

roast beef must do for us. You see, love, we've a family.""



""Only one, Jem! I don't want more than roast beef, though, I'm sure.

Before I went to service, mother and me would have thought roast beef

a very fine dinner.""



""Well, let's settle it then, roast beef and a plum-pudding; and now,

good-by. Mind and take care of little Tom. I thought he was a bit hoarse

this morning.""



And off he went to his work.



Now, it was a good while since Mrs. Jenkins and Mrs. Hodgson had spoken

to each other, although they were quite as much in possession of the

knowledge of events and opinions as though they did. Mary knew that Mrs.

Jenkins despised her for not having a real lace cap, which Mrs. Jenkins

had; and for having been a servant, which Mrs. Jenkins had not; and the

little occasional pinchings which the Hodgsons were obliged to resort

to, to make both ends meet, would have been very patiently endured by

Mary, if she had not winced under Mrs. Jenkins's knowledge of such

economy. But she had her revenge. She had a child, and Mrs. Jenkins had

none. To have had a child, even such a puny baby as little Tom, Mrs.

Jenkins would have worn commonest caps, and cleaned grates, and drudged

her fingers to the bone. The great unspoken disappointment of her life

soured her temper, and turned her thoughts inward, and made her morbid

and selfish.



""Hang that cat! he's been stealing again! he's gnawed the cold mutton in

his nasty mouth till it's not fit to set before a Christian; and I've

nothing else for Jem's dinner. But I'll give it him now I've caught him,

that I will!""



So saying, Mary Hodgson caught up her husband's Sunday cane, and despite

pussy's cries and scratches, she gave him such a beating as she hoped

might cure him of his thievish propensities; when lo! and behold, Mrs.

Jenkins stood at the door with a face of bitter wrath.



""Aren't you ashamed of yourself, ma'am, to abuse a poor dumb animal,

ma'am, as knows no better than to take food when he sees it, ma'am? He

only follows the nature which God has given, ma'am; and it's a pity your

nature, ma'am, which I've heard, is of the stingy saving species, does

not make you shut your cupboard-door a little closer. There is such a

thing as law for brute animals. I'll ask Mr. Jenkins, but I don't think

them Radicals has done away with that law yet, for all their Reform

Bill, ma'am. My poor precious love of a Tommy, is he hurt? and is his

leg broke for taking a mouthful of scraps, as most people would give

away to a beggar,--if he'd take 'em?"" wound up Mrs. Jenkins, casting a

contemptuous look on the remnant of a scrag end of mutton.



Mary felt very angry and very guilty. For she really pitied the poor

limping animal as he crept up to his mistress, and there lay down to

bemoan himself; she wished she had not beaten him so hard, for it

certainly was her own careless way of never shutting the cupboard-door

that had tempted him to his fault. But the sneer at her little bit of

mutton turned her penitence to fresh wrath, and she shut the door in

Mrs. Jenkins's face, as she stood caressing her cat in the lobby, with

such a bang, that it wakened little Tom, and he began to cry.



Everything was to go wrong with Mary to-day. Now baby was awake, who was

to take her husband's dinner to the office? She took the child in her

arms, and tried to hush him off to sleep again, and as she sung she

cried, she could hardly tell why,--a sort of reaction from her violent

angry feelings. She wished she had never beaten the poor cat; she wondered

if his leg was really broken. What would her mother say if she knew how

cross and cruel her little Mary was getting? If she should live to beat

her child in one of her angry fits?



It was of no use lullabying while she sobbed so; it must be given up,

and she must just carry her baby in her arms, and take him with her to

the office, for it was long past dinner-time. So she pared the mutton

carefully, although by so doing she reduced the meat to an infinitesimal

quantity, and taking the baked potatoes out of the oven, she popped them

piping hot into her basket with the et-cteras of plate, butter, salt,

and knife and fork.



It was, indeed, a bitter wind. She bent against it as she ran, and the

flakes of snow were sharp and cutting as ice. Baby cried all the way,

though she cuddled him up in her shawl. Then her husband had made his

appetite up for a potato pie, and (literary man as he was) his body got

so much the better of his mind, that he looked rather black at the cold

mutton. Mary had no appetite for her own dinner when she arrived at

home again. So, after she had tried to feed baby, and he had fretfully

refused to take his bread and milk, she laid him down as usual on his

quilt, surrounded by playthings, while she sided away, and chopped

suet for the next day's pudding. Early in the afternoon a parcel came,

done up first in brown paper, then in such a white, grass-bleached,

sweet-smelling towel, and a note from her dear, dear mother; in which

quaint writing she endeavoured to tell her daughter that she was not

forgotten at Christmas time; but that learning that Farmer Burton was

killing his pig, she had made interest for some of his famous pork, out

of which she had manufactured some sausages, and flavoured them just as

Mary used to like when she lived at home.



""Dear, dear mother!"" said Mary to herself. ""There never was any one like

her for remembering other folk. What rare sausages she used to make!

Home things have a smack with 'em, no bought things can ever have. Set

them up with their sausages! I've a notion if Mrs. Jenkins had ever

tasted mother's she'd have no fancy for them town-made things Fanny took

in just now.""



And so she went on thinking about home, till the smiles and the dimples

came out again at the remembrance of that pretty cottage, which would

look green even now in the depth of winter, with its pyracanthus, and

its holly-bushes, and the great Portugal laurel that was her mother's

pride. And the back path through the orchard to Farmer Burton's; how

well she remembered it. The bushels of unripe apples she had picked up

there, and distributed among his pigs, till he had scolded her for

giving them so much green trash.



She was interrupted--her baby (I call him a baby, because his father and

mother did, and because he was so little of his age, but I rather think

he was eighteen months old,) had fallen asleep some time before among

his playthings; an uneasy, restless sleep; but of which Mary had been

thankful, as his morning's nap had been too short, and as she was so

busy. But now he began to make such a strange crowing noise, just like

a chair drawn heavily and gratingly along a kitchen-floor! His eyes was

open, but expressive of nothing but pain.



""Mother's darling!"" said Mary, in terror, lifting him up. ""Baby, try not

to make that noise. Hush, hush, darling; what hurts him?"" But the noise

came worse and worse.



""Fanny! Fanny!"" Mary called in mortal fright, for her baby was almost

black with his gasping breath, and she had no one to ask for aid

or sympathy but her landlady's daughter, a little girl of twelve or

thirteen, who attended to the house in her mother's absence, as daily

cook in gentlemen's families. Fanny was more especially considered the

attendant of the upstairs lodgers (who paid for the use of the kitchin,

""for Jenkins could not abide the smell of meat cooking""), but just now

she was fortunately sitting at her afternoon's work of darning

stockings, and hearing Mrs. Hodgson's cry of terror, she ran to her

sitting-room, and understood the case at a glance.



""He's got the croup! Oh, Mrs. Hodgson, he'll die as sure as fate. Little

brother had it, and he died in no time. The doctor said he could do

nothing for him--it had gone too far. He said if we'd put him in a warm

bath at first, it might have saved him; but, bless you! he was never

half so bad as your baby."" Unconsciously there mingled in her statement

some of a child's love of producing an effect; but the increasing

danger was clear enough.



""Oh, my baby! my baby! Oh, love, love! don't look so ill; I cannot

bear it. And my fire so low! There, I was thinking of home, and picking

currants, and never minding the fire. Oh, Fanny! what is the fire like

in the kitchen? Speak.""



""Mother told me to screw it up, and throw some slack on as soon as Mrs.

Jenkins had done with it, and so I did. It's very low and black. But,

oh, Mrs. Hodgson! let me run for the doctor--I cannot abear to hear him,

it's so like little brother.""



Through her streaming tears Mary motioned her to go; and trembling,

sinking, sick at heart, she laid her boy in his cradle, and ran to fill

her kettle.



Mrs. Jenkins, having cooked her husband's snug little dinner, to which

he came home; having told him her story of pussy's beating, at which he

was justly and dignifiedly indignant, saying it was all of a piece with

that abusive _Examiner_; having received the sausages, and turkey, and

mince pies, which her husband had ordered; and cleaned up the room, and

prepared everything for tea, and coaxed and duly bemoaned her cat (who

had pretty nearly forgotten his beating, but very much enjoyed the

petting), having done all these and many other things, Mrs. Jenkins sate

down to get up the real lace cap. Every thread was pulled out

separately, and carefully stretched: when, what was that? Outside, in

the street, a chorus of piping children's voices sang the old carol she

had heard a hundred times in the days of her youth:--



  ""As Joseph was a walking he heard an angel sing,

  'This night shall be born our heavenly King.

  He neither shall be born in housen nor in hall,

  Nor in the place of Paradise, but in an ox's stall.

  He neither shall be clothed in purple nor in pall,

  But all in fair linen, as were babies all:

  He neither shall be rocked in silver nor in gold,

  But in a wooden cradle that rocks on the mould,'"" &c.



She got up and went to the window. There, below, stood the group of grey

black little figures, relieved against the snow, which now enveloped

everything. ""For old sake's sake,"" as she phrased it, she counted out a

halfpenny apiece for the singers, out of the copper bag, and threw them

down below.



The room had become chilly while she had been counting out and throwing

down her money, so she stirred her already glowing fire, and sat down

right before it--but not to stretch her lace; like Mary Hodgson, she

began to think over long-past days, on softening remembrances of the

dead and gone, on words long forgotten, on holy stories heard at her

mother's knee.



""I cannot think what's come over me to-night,"" said she, half aloud,

recovering herself by the sound of her own voice from her train of

thought--""My head goes wandering on them old times. I'm sure more texts

have come into my head with thinking on my mother within this last half

hour, than I've thought on for years and years. I hope I'm not going to

die. Folks say, thinking too much on the dead betokens we're going to

join 'em; I should be loth to go just yet--such a fine turkey as we've

got for dinner to-morrow, too!""



Knock, knock, knock, at the door, as fast as knuckles could go. And

then, as if the comer could not wait, the door was opened, and Mary

Hodgson stood there as white as death.



""Mrs. Jenkins!--oh, your kettle is boiling, thank God! Let me have the

water for my baby, for the love of God! He's got croup, and is dying!""



Mrs. Jenkins turned on her chair with a wooden inflexible look on her

face, that (between ourselves) her husband knew and dreaded for all his

pompous dignity.



""I'm sorry I can't oblige you, ma'am; my kettle is wanted for my

husband's tea. Don't be afeared, Tommy, Mrs. Hodgson won't venture to

intrude herself where she's not desired. You'd better send for the

doctor, ma'am, instead of wasting your time in wringing your hands,

ma'am--my kettle is engaged.""



Mary clasped her hands together with passionate force, but spoke no word

of entreaty to that wooden face--that sharp, determined voice; but, as

she turned away, she prayed for strength to bear the coming trial, and

strength to forgive Mrs. Jenkins.



Mrs. Jenkins watched her go away meekly, as one who has no hope, and

then she turned upon herself as sharply as she ever did on any one else.



""What a brute I am, Lord forgive me! What's my husband's tea to a baby's

life? In croup, too, where time is everything. You crabbed old vixen,

you!--any one may know you never had a child!""



She was down stairs (kettle in hand) before she had finished her

self-upbraiding; and when in Mrs. Hodgson's room, she rejected all

thanks (Mary had not the voice for many words), saying, stiffly, ""I do

it for the poor babby's sake, ma'am, hoping he may live to have mercy

to poor dumb beasts, if he does forget to lock his cupboards.""



But she did everything, and more than Mary, with her young inexperience,

could have thought of. She prepared the warm bath, and tried it with her

husband's own thermometer (Mr. Jenkins was as punctual as clockwork in

noting down the temperature of every day). She let his mother place her

baby in the tub, still preserving the same rigid, affronted aspect, and

then she went upstairs without a word. Mary longed to ask her to stay,

but dared not; though, when she left the room, the tears chased each

other down her cheeks faster than ever. Poor young mother! how she

counted the minutes till the doctor should come. But, before he came,

down again stalked Mrs. Jenkins, with something in her hand.



""I've seen many of these croup-fits, which, I take it, you've not, ma'am.

Mustard plaisters is very sovereign, put on the throat; I've been up and

made one, ma'am, and, by your leave, I'll put it on the poor little

fellow.""



Mary could not speak, but she signed her grateful assent.



It began to smart while they still kept silence; and he looked up to his

mother as if seeking courage from her looks to bear the stinging pain;

but she was softly crying, to see him suffer, and her want of courage

reacted upon him, and he began to sob aloud. Instantly Mrs. Jenkins's

apron was up, hiding her face: ""Peep-bo, baby,"" said she, as merrily

as she could. His little face brightened, and his mother having once

got the cue, the two women kept the little fellow amused, until his

plaister had taken effect.



""He's better,--oh, Mrs. Jenkins, look at his eyes! how different! And he

breathes quite softly----""



As Mary spoke thus, the doctor entered. He examined his patient. Baby

was really better.



""It has been a sharp attack, but the remedies you have applied have been

worth all the Pharmacopoeia an hour later.--I shall send a powder,"" &c.

&c.



Mrs. Jenkins stayed to hear this opinion; and (her heart wonderfully

more easy) was going to leave the room, when Mary seized her hand and

kissed it; she could not speak her gratitude.



Mrs. Jenkins looked affronted and awkward, and as if she must go

upstairs and wash her hand directly.



But, in spite of these sour looks, she came softly down an hour or so

afterwards to see how baby was.



The little gentleman slept well after the fright he had given his

friends; and on Christmas morning, when Mary awoke and looked at the

sweet little pale face lying on her arm, she could hardly realize the

danger he had been in.



When she came down (later than usual), she found the household in a

commotion. What do you think had happened? Why, pussy had been a traitor

to his best friend, and eaten up some of Mr. Jenkins's own especial

sausages; and gnawed and tumbled the rest so, that they were not fit to

be eaten! There were no bounds to that cat's appetite! he would have

eaten his own father if he had been tender enough. And now Mrs. Jenkins

stormed and cried--""Hang the cat!""



Christmas Day, too! and all the shops shut! ""What was turkey without

sausages?"" gruffly asked Mr. Jenkins.



""Oh, Jem!"" whispered Mary, ""hearken what a piece of work he's making

about sausages,--I should like to take Mrs. Jenkins up some of mother's;

they're twice as good as bought sausages.""



""I see no objection, my dear. Sausages do not involve intimacies, else

his politics are what I can no ways respect.""



""But, oh, Jem, if you had seen her last night about baby! I'm sure

she may scold me for ever, and I'll not answer. I'd even make her cat

welcome to the sausages."" The tears gathered to Mary's eyes as she

kissed her boy.



""Better take 'em upstairs, my dear, and give them to the cat's

mistress."" And Jem chuckled at his saying.



Mary put them on a plate, but still she loitered.



""What must I say, Jem? I never know.""



""Say--I hope you'll accept of these sausages, as my mother--no, that's

not grammar;--say what comes uppermost, Mary, it will be sure to be

right.""



So Mary carried them upstairs and knocked at the door; and when told to

""come in,"" she looked very red, but went up to Mrs. Jenkins, saying,

""Please take these. Mother made them."" And was away before an answer

could be given.



Just as Hodgson was ready to go to church, Mrs. Jenkins came downstairs,

and called Fanny. In a minute, the latter entered the Hodgsons' room,

and delivered Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins's compliments, and they would be

particular glad if Mr. and Mrs. Hodgson would eat their dinner with

them.



""And carry baby upstairs in a shawl, be sure,"" added Mrs. Jenkins's

voice in the passage, close to the door, whither she had followed her

messenger. There was no discussing the matter, with the certainty of

every word being overheard.



Mary looked anxiously at her husband. She remembered his saying he did

not approve of Mr. Jenkins's politics.



""Do you think it would do for baby?"" asked he.



""Oh, yes,"" answered she, eagerly; ""I would wrap him up so warm.""



""And I've got our room up to sixty-five already, for all it's so

frosty,"" added the voice outside.



Now, how do you think they settled the matter? The very best way in the

world. Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins came down into the Hodgsons' room, and dined

there. Turkey at the top, roast beef at the bottom, sausages at one side,

potatoes at the other. Second course, plum-pudding at the top, and mince

pies at the bottom.



And after dinner, Mrs. Jenkins would have baby on her knee; and he

seemed quite to take to her; she declared he was admiring the real lace

on her cap, but Mary thought (though she did not say so) that he was

pleased by her kind looks and coaxing words. Then he was wrapped up and

carried carefully upstairs to tea, in Mrs. Jenkins's room. And after

tea, Mrs. Jenkins, and Mary, and her husband, found out each other's

mutual liking for music, and sat singing old glees and catches, till I

don't know what o'clock, without one word of politics or newspapers.



Before they parted, Mary had coaxed pussy on to her knee; for Mrs.

Jenkins would not part with baby, who was sleeping on her lap.



""When you're busy, bring him to me. Do, now, it will be a real favour. I

know you must have a deal to do, with another coming; let him come up to

me. I'll take the greatest of cares of him; pretty darling, how sweet he

looks when he's asleep!""



When the couples were once more alone, the husbands unburdened their

minds to their wives.



Mr. Jenkins said to his--""Do you know, Burgess tried to make me believe

Hodgson was such a fool as to put paragraphs into the _Examiner_ now and

then; but I see he knows his place, and has got too much sense to do any

such thing.""



Hodgson said--""Mary, love, I almost fancy from Jenkins's way of speaking

(so much civiler than I expected), he guesses I wrote that 'Pro Bono'

and the 'Rose-bud,'--at any rate, I've no objection to your naming it,

if the subject should come uppermost; I should like him to know I'm a

literary man.""



Well! I've ended my tale; I hope you don't think it too long; but, before

I go, just let me say one thing.



If any of you have any quarrels, or misunderstandings, or coolnesses, or

cold shoulders, or shynesses, or tiffs, or miffs, or huffs, with any one

else, just make friends before Christmas,--you will be so much merrier

if you do.



I ask it of you for the sake of that old angelic song, heard so many

years ago by the shepherds, keeping watch by night, on Bethlehem

Heights.









HAND AND HEART.





""Mother, I should so like to have a great deal of money,"" said little

Tom Fletcher one evening, as he sat on a low stool by his mother's knee.

His mother was knitting busily by the firelight, and they had both been

silent for some time.



""What would you do with a great deal of money if you had it?""



""Oh! I don't know--I would do a great many things. But should not you

like to have a great deal of money, mother?"" persisted he.



""Perhaps I should,"" answered Mrs. Fletcher. ""I am like you sometimes,

dear, and think that I should be very glad of a little more money. But

then I don't think I am like you in one thing, for I have always some

little plan in my mind, for which I should want the money. I never wish

for it just for its own sake.""



""Why, mother! there are so many things we could do if we had but

money;--real good, wise things I mean.""



""And if we have real good, wise things in our head to do, which cannot

be done without money, I can quite enter into the wish for money. But

you know, my little boy, you did not tell me of any good or wise

thing.""



""No! I believe I was not thinking of good or wise things just then, but

only how much I should like money to do what I liked,"" answered little

Tom ingenuously, looking up in his mother's face. She smiled down upon

him, and stroked his head. He knew she was pleased with him for having

told her openly what was passing in his mind. Presently he began again.



""Mother, if you wanted to do something very good and wise, and if you

could not do it without money, what should you do?""



""There are two ways of obtaining money for such wants; one is by earning;

and the other is by saving. Now both are good, because both imply

self-denial. Do you understand me, Tom? If you have to earn money, you

must steadily go on doing what you do not like perhaps; such as working

when you would like to be playing, or in bed, or sitting talking with me

over the fire. You deny yourself these little pleasures; and that is

a good habit in itself, to say nothing of the industry and energy you

have to exert in working. If you save money, you can easily see how you

exercise self-denial. You do without something you wish for in order to

possess the money it would have cost. Inasmuch as self-denial, energy,

and industry are all good things, you do well either to earn or to save.

But you see the purpose for which you want the money must be taken into

consideration. You say, for 'something wise and good.' Either earning or

saving becomes holy in this case. I must then think which will be most

consistent with my other duties, before I decide whether I will earn or

save money.""



""I don't quite know what you mean, mother.""



""I will try and explain myself. You know I have to keep a little shop,

and to try and get employment in knitting stockings, and to clean my

house, and to mend our clothes, and many other things. Now, do you think

I should be doing my duty if I left you in the evenings, when you come

home from school, to go out as a waiter at ladies' parties? I could earn

a good deal of money by it, and I could spend it well among those who

are poorer than I am (such as lame Harry), but then I should be leaving

you alone in the little time that we have to be together; I do not think

I should be doing right even for our 'good and wise purpose' to earn

money, if it took me away from you at nights: do you, Tom?""



""No, indeed; you never mean to do it, do you, mother?""



""No,"" said she, smiling; ""at any rate not till you are older. You see at

present then, I cannot _earn_ money, if I want a little more than usual

to help a sick neighbour. I must then try and _save_ money. Nearly every

one can do that.""



""Can _we_, mother? We are so careful of everything. Ned Dixon calls us

stingy: what could _we save_?""



""Oh, many and many a little thing. We use many things which are

luxuries; which we do not want, but only use them for pleasure. Tea and

sugar--butter--our Sunday's dinner of bacon or meat--the grey ribbon I

bought for my bonnet, because you thought it prettier than the black,

which was cheaper; all these are luxuries. We use very little tea or

sugar, it is true; but we might do without any.""



""You did do without any, mother, for a long, long time, you know, to

help widow Black; it was only for your bad head-aches.""



""Well! but you see we can save money; a penny, a halfpenny a day, or

even a penny a week, would in time make a little store ready to be

applied to the 'good and wise' purpose, when the time comes. But do you

know, my little boy, I think we may be considering money too much as the

only thing required if we want to do a kindness.""



""If it is not the only thing, it is the chief thing, at any rate.""



""No, love, it is not the chief thing. I should think very poorly of that

beggar who liked sixpence given with a curse (as I have sometimes heard

it), better than the kind and gentle words some people use in refusing

to give. The curse sinks deep into the heart; or if it does not, it

is a proof that the poor creature has been made hard before by harsh

treatment. And mere money can do little to cheer a sore heart. It is

kindness only that can do this. Now we have all of us kindness in our

power. The little child of two years old, who can only just totter

about, can show kindness?""



""Can I, mother?""



""To be sure, dear; and you often do, only perhaps not quite so often as

you might do. Neither do I. But instead of wishing for money (of which I

don't think either you or I are ever likely to have much), suppose you

try to-morrow how you can make people happier, by thinking of little

loving actions of help. Let us try and take for our text, 'Silver and

gold I have none, but such as I have give I unto thee.'""



""Ay, mother, we will.""



Must I tell you about little Tom's ""to-morrow.""



I do not know if little Tom dreamed of what his mother and he had been

talking about, but I do know that the first thing he thought about, when

he awoke in the morning, was his mother's saying that he might try how

many kind actions he could do that day without money; and he was so

impatient to begin, that he jumped up and dressed himself, although

it was more than an hour before his usual time of getting up. All the

time he kept wondering what a little boy like him, only eight years old,

could do for other people; till at last he grew so puzzled with inventing

occasions for showing kindness, that he very wisely determined to think

no more about it, but learn his lessons very perfectly; that was the

first thing he had to do; and then he would try, without too much planning

beforehand, to keep himself ready to lend a helping hand, or to give

a kind word, when the right time came. So he screwed himself into a

corner, out of the way of his mother's sweeping and dusting, and tucked

his feet up on the rail of the chair, turned his face to the wall, and

in about half an hour's time, he could turn round with a light heart,

feeling he had learnt his lesson well, and might employ his time as he

liked till breakfast was ready. He looked round the room; his mother

had arranged all neatly, and was now gone to the bedroom; but the

coal-scuttle and the can for water were empty, and Tom ran away to fill

them; and as he came back with the latter from the pump, he saw Ann

Jones (the scold of the neighbourhood) hanging out her clothes on a line

stretched across from side to side of the little court, and speaking

very angrily and loudly to her little girl, who was getting into some

mischief in the house-place, as her mother perceived through the open

door.



""There never were such plagues as my children are, to be sure,"" said Ann

Jones, as she went into her house, looking very red and passionate.

Directly after, Tom heard the sound of a slap, and then a little child's

cry of pain.



""I wonder,"" thought he, ""if I durst go and offer to nurse and play with

little Hester. Ann Jones is fearful cross, and just as likely to take me

wrong as right; but she won't box me for mother's sake; mother nursed

Jemmy many a day through the fever, so she won't slap me, I think. Any

rate, I'll try."" But it was with a beating heart he said to the

fierce-looking Mrs. Jones, ""Please, may I go and play with Hester. May

be I could keep her quiet while you're busy hanging out clothes.""



""What! and let you go slopping about, I suppose, just when I'd made

all ready for my master's breakfast. Thank you, but my own children's

mischief is as much as I reckon on; I'll have none of strange lads in my

house.""



""I did not mean to do mischief or slop,"" said Tom, a little sadly at

being misunderstood in his good intentions. ""I only wanted to help.""



""If you want to help, lift me up those clothes' pegs, and save me

stooping; my back's broken with it.""



Tom would much rather have gone to play with and amuse little Hester;

but it was true enough that giving Mrs. Jones the clothes' pegs as she

wanted them would help her as much; and perhaps keep her from being so

cross with her children if they did anything to hinder her. Besides,

little Hester's cry had died away, and she was evidently occupied in

some new pursuit (Tom could only hope that it was not in mischief this

time); so he began to give Ann the pegs as she wanted them, and she,

soothed by his kind help, opened her heart a little to him.



""I wonder how it is your mother has trained you up to be so handy, Tom;

you're as good as a girl--better than many a girl. I don't think Hester

in three years' time will be as thoughtful as you. There!"" (as a fresh

scream reached them from the little ones inside the house), ""they are at

some mischief again; but I'll teach 'em,"" said she, getting down from

her stool in a fresh access of passion.



""Let me go,"" said Tom, in a begging voice, for he dreaded the cruel

sound of another slap. ""I'll lift the basket of pegs on to a stool, so

that you need not stoop; and I'll keep the little ones safe out of

mischief till you're done. Do let me go, missus.""



With some grumblings at losing his help, she let him go into the

house-place. He found Hester, a little girl of five, and two younger ones.

They had been fighting for a knife, and in the struggle, the second,

Johnnie, had cut his finger--not very badly, but he was frightened at

the sight of the blood; and Hester, who might have helped, and who was

really sorry, stood sullenly aloof, dreading the scolding her mother

always gave her if either of the little ones hurt themselves while under

her care.



""Hester,"" said Tom, ""will you get me some cold water, please? it will

stop the bleeding better than anything. I daresay you can find me a

basin to hold it.""



Hester trotted off, pleased at Tom's confidence in her power. When the

bleeding was partly stopped, he asked her to find him a bit of rag, and

she scrambled under the dresser for a little piece she had hidden there

the day before. Meanwhile, Johnny ceased crying, he was so interested in

all the preparation for dressing his little wound, and so much pleased

to find himself an object of so much attention and consequence. The

baby, too, sat on the floor, gravely wondering at the commotion; and

thus busily occupied, they were quiet and out of mischief till Ann Jones

came in, and, having hung out her clothes, and finished that morning's

piece of work, she was ready to attend to her children in her rough,

hasty kind of way.



[Illustration p. 220: The Cut Finger.]



""Well! I'm sure, Tom, you've tied it up as neatly as I could have done.

I wish I'd always such an one as you to see after the children; but you

must run off now, lad, your mother was calling you as I came in, and I

said I'd send you--good-by, and thank you.""



As Tom was going away, the baby, sitting in square gravity on the floor,

but somehow conscious of Tom's gentle helpful ways, put up her mouth to

be kissed; and he stooped down in answer to the little gesture, feeling

very happy, and very full of love and kindliness.



After breakfast, his mother told him it was school time, and he must set

off, as she did not like him to run in out of breath and flurried, just

when the schoolmaster was going to begin; but she wished him to come in

decently and in order, with quiet decorum, and thoughtfulness as to what

he was going to do. So Tom got his cap and his bag, and went off with

a light heart, which I suppose made his footsteps light, for he found

himself above half way to school while it wanted yet a quarter to the

time. So he slackened his pace, and looked about him a little more than

he had been doing. There was a little girl on the other side of the

street carrying a great big basket, and lugging along a little child

just able to walk; but who, I suppose, was tired, for he was crying

pitifully, and sitting down every two or three steps. Tom ran across the

street, for, as perhaps you have found out, he was very fond of babies,

and could not bear to hear them cry.



""Little girl, what is he crying about? Does he want to be carried? I'll

take him up, and carry him as far as I go alongside of you.""



So saying, Tom was going to suit the action to the word; but the baby

did not choose that any one should carry him but his sister, and refused

Tom's kindness. Still he could carry the heavy basket of potatoes for

the little girl, which he did as far as their road lay together, when

she thanked him, and bade him good-by, and said she could manage very

well now, her home was so near. So Tom went into school very happy and

peaceful; and had a good character to take home to his mother for that

morning's lesson.



It happened that this very day was the weekly half-holiday, so that Tom

had many hours unoccupied that afternoon. Of course, his first

employment after dinner was to learn his lessons for the next day; and

then, when he had put his books away, he began to wonder what he should

do next.



He stood lounging against the door wishing all manner of idle wishes;

a habit he was apt to fall into. He wished he were the little boy

who lived opposite, who had three brothers ready to play with him on

half-holidays; he wished he were Sam Harrison, whose father had taken

him one day a trip by the railroad; he wished he were the little boy who

always went with the omnibuses,--it must be so pleasant to go riding

about on the step, and to see so many people; he wished he were a

sailor, to sail away to the countries where grapes grew wild, and

monkeys and parrots were to be had for the catching. Just as he was

wishing himself the little Prince of Wales, to drive about in a

goat-carriage, and wondering if he should not feel very shy with the

three great ostrich-feathers always niddle-noddling on his head, for

people to know him by, his mother came from washing up the dishes, and

saw him deep in the reveries little boys and girls are apt to fall into

when they are the only children in a house.



""My dear Tom,"" said she, ""why don't you go out, and make the most of

this fine afternoon?""



""Oh, mother,"" answered he (suddenly recalled to the fact that he was

little Tom Fletcher, instead of the Prince of Wales, and consequently

feeling a little bit flat), ""it is so dull going out by myself. I have

no one to play with. Can't you go with me, mother--just this once, into

the fields?""



Poor Mrs. Fletcher heartily wished she could gratify this very natural

desire of her little boy; but she had the shop to mind, and many a

little thing besides to do; it was impossible. But however much she

might regret a thing, she was too faithful to repine. So, after a

moment's thought, she said, cheerfully, ""Go into the fields for a walk,

and see how many wild flowers you can bring me home, and I'll get down

father's jug for you to put them in when you come back.""



""But, mother, there are so few pretty flowers near a town,"" said Tom, a

little unwillingly, for it was a coming down from being Prince of Wales,

and he was not yet quite reconciled to it.



""Oh dear! there are a great many if you'll only look for them. I dare

say you'll make me up as many as twenty different kinds.""



""Will you reckon daisies, mother?""



""To be sure; they are just as pretty as any.""



""Oh, if you'll reckon such as them, I dare say I can bring you more than

twenty.""



So off he ran; his mother watching him till he was out of sight, and

then she returned to her work. In about two hours he came back, his pale

cheeks looking quite rosy, and his eyes quite bright. His country walk,

taken with cheerful spirits, had done him all the good his mother

desired, and had restored his usually even, happy temper.



""Look, mother! here are three-and-twenty different kinds; you said I

might count all, so I have even counted this thing like a nettle with

lilac flowers, and this little common blue thing.""



""Robin-run-in-the-hedge is its name,"" said his mother. ""It's very pretty

if you look at it close. One, two, three""--she counted them all over,

and there really were three-and-twenty. She went to reach down the best

jug.



""Mother,"" said little Tom, ""do you like them very much?""



""Yes, very much,"" said she, not understanding his meaning. He was

silent, and gave a little sigh. ""Why, my dear?""



""Oh, only--it does not signify if you like them very much; but I thought

how nice it would be to take them to lame Harry, who can never walk so

far as the fields, and can hardly know what summer is like, I think.""



""Oh, that will be very nice; I am glad you thought of it.""



Lame Harry was sitting by himself, very patiently, in a neighbouring

cellar. He was supported by his daughter's earnings; but as she worked

in a factory, he was much alone.



If the bunch of flowers had looked pretty in the fields, they looked

ten times as pretty in the cellar to which they were now carried. Lame

Harry's eyes brightened up with pleasure at the sight; and he began to

talk of the times long ago, when he was a little boy in the country, and

had a corner of his father's garden to call his own, and grow lad's-love

and wall-flower in. Little Tom put them in water for him, and put the

jug on the table by him; on which his daughter had placed the old Bible,

worn with much reading, although treated with careful reverence. It was

lying open, with Harry's horn spectacles put in to mark the place.



""I reckon my spectacles are getting worn out; they are not so clear as

they used to be; they are dim-like before my eyes, and it hurts me to

read long together,"" said Harry. ""It's a sad miss to me. I never thought

the time long when I could read; but now I keep wearying for the day to

be over, though the nights, when I cannot sleep for my legs paining me,

are almost as bad. However, it's the Lord's will.""



""Would you like me--I cannot read very well aloud, but I'd do my best,

if you'd like me to read a bit to you. I'll just run home and get my

tea, and be back directly."" And off Tom ran.



He found it very pleasant reading aloud to lame Harry, for the old man

had so much to say that was worth listening to, and was so glad of a

listener, that I think there was as much talking as reading done that

evening. But the Bible served as a text-book to their conversation;

for in a long life old Harry had seen and heard so much, which he

had connected with events, or promises, or precepts contained in the

Scriptures, that it was quite curious to find how everything was brought

in and dove-tailed, as an illustration of what they were reading.



When Tom got up to go away, lame Harry gave him many thanks, and told

him he would not sleep the worse for having made an old man's evening

so pleasant. Tom came home in high self-satisfaction. ""Mother,"" said

he, ""it's all very true what you said about the good that may be done

without money: I've done many pieces of good to-day without a farthing.

First,"" said he, taking hold of his little finger, ""I helped Ann Jones

with hanging out her clothes when she was""--



His mother had been listening while she turned over the pages of the New

Testament which lay by her, and now having found what she wanted, she

put her arm gently round his waist, and drew him fondly towards her. He

saw her finger put under one passage, and read,--



""Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.""



He was silent in a moment.



Then his mother spoke in her soft low voice:--""Dearest Tom, though I

don't want us to talk about it, as if you had been doing more than just

what you ought, I am glad you have seen the truth of what I said; how

far more may be done by the loving heart than by mere money-giving; and

every one may have the loving heart.""



I have told you of one day of little Tom's life, when he was eight years

old, and lived with his mother. I must now pass over a year, and tell

you of a very different kind of life he had then to lead. His mother had

never been very strong, and had had a good deal of anxiety; at last she

was taken ill, and soon felt that there was no hope for her recovery.

For a long time the thought of leaving her little boy was a great distress

to her, and a great trial to her faith. But God strengthened her, and

sent his peace into her soul, and before her death she was content to

leave her precious child in his hands, who is a Father to the

fatherless, and defendeth the cause of the widow.



When she felt that she had not many more days to live, she sent for her

husband's brother, who lived in a town not many miles off; and gave her

little Tom in charge to him to bring up.



""There are a few pounds in the savings-bank--I don't know how many

exactly--and the furniture and bit of stock in the shop; perhaps they

would be enough to bring him up to be a joiner, like his father before

him.""



She spoke feebly, and with many pauses. Her brother-in-law, though a

rough kind of man, wished to do all he could to make her feel easy in

her last moments, and touched with the reference to his dead brother,

promised all she required.



""I'll take him back with me after""--the funeral, he was going to say,

but he stopped. She smiled gently, fully understanding his meaning.



""We shall, may be, not be so tender with him as you've been; but I'll

see he comes to no harm. It will be a good thing for him to rough it a

bit with other children,--he's too nesh for a boy; but I'll pay them if

they aren't kind to him in the long run, never fear.""



Though this speech was not exactly what she liked, there was quite

enough of good feeling in it to make her thankful for such a protector

and friend for her boy. And so, thankful for the joys she had had, and

thankful for the sorrows which had taught her meekness, thankful for

life, and thankful for death, she died.



Her brother-in-law arranged all as she had wished. After the quiet

simple funeral was over, he took Tom by the hand, and set off on the

six-mile walk to his home. Tom had cried till he could cry no more, but

sobs came quivering up from his heart every now and then, as he passed

some well-remembered cottage, or thorn-bush, or tree on the road. His

uncle was very sorry for him, but did not know what to say, or how to

comfort him.



""Now mind, lad, thou com'st to me if thy cousins are o'er hard upon

thee. Let me hear if they misuse thee, and I'll give it them.""



Tom shrunk from the idea that this gave him of the cousins, whose

companionship he had, until then, been looking forward to as a pleasure.

He was not reassured when, after threading several streets and by-ways,

they came into a court of dingy-looking houses, and his uncle opened the

door of one, from which the noise of loud, if not angry voices was

heard.



A tall large woman was whirling one child out of her way with a rough

movement of her arm; while she was scolding a boy a little older than

Tom, who stood listening sullenly to her angry words.



""I'll tell father of thee, I will,"" said she; and turning to uncle John,

she began to pour out her complaints against Jack, without taking any

notice of little Tom, who clung to his uncle's hand as to a protector in

the scene of violence into which he had entered.



""Well, well, wife!--I'll leather Jack the next time I catch him letting

the water out of the pipe; but now get this lad and me some tea, for

we're weary and tired.""



His aunt seemed to wish Jack might be leathered now, and to be angry

with her husband for not revenging her injuries; for an injury it was

that the boy had done her in letting the water all run off, and that on

the very eve of the washing day. The mother grumbled as she left off

mopping the wet floor, and went to the fire to stir it up ready for the

kettle, without a word of greeting to her little nephew, or of welcome

to her husband. On the contrary, she complained of the trouble of getting

tea ready afresh, just when she had put slack on the fire, and had no

water in the house to fill the kettle with. Her husband grew angry, and

Tom was frightened to hear his uncle speaking sharply.



""If I can't have a cup of tea in my own house without all this ado, I'll

go to the Spread Eagle, and take Tom with me. They've a bright fire

there at all times, choose how they manage it; and no scolding wives.

Come, Tom, let's be off.""



Jack had been trying to scrape acquaintance with his cousin by winks and

grimaces behind his mother's back, and now made a sign of drinking out

of an imaginary glass. But Tom clung to his uncle, and softly pulled him

down again on his chair, from which he had risen to go to the

public-house.



""If you please, ma'am,"" said he, sadly frightened of his aunt, ""I think

I could find the pump, if you'd let me try.""



She muttered something like an acquiescence; so Tom took up the kettle,

and, tired as he was, went out to the pump. Jack, who had done nothing

but mischief all day, stood amazed, but at last settled that his cousin

was a ""softy.""



When Tom came back, he tried to blow the fire with the broken bellows,

and at last the water boiled, and the tea was made. ""Thou'rt a rare lad,

Tom,"" said his uncle. ""I wonder when our Jack will be of as much use.""



This comparison did not please either Jack or his mother, who liked to

keep to herself the privilege of directing their father's dissatisfaction

with his children. Tom felt their want of kindliness towards him; and

now that he had nothing to do but rest and eat, he began to feel very

sad, and his eyes kept filling with tears, which he brushed away with

the back of his hand, not wishing to have them seen. But his uncle

noticed him.



""Thou had'st better have had a glass at the Spread Eagle,"" said he,

compassionately.



""No; I only am rather tired. May I go to bed?"" said he, longing for a

good cry unobserved under the bed-clothes.



""Where's he to sleep?"" asked the husband of the wife.



""Nay,"" said she, still offended on Jack's account, ""that's thy look-out.

He's thy flesh and blood, not mine.""



""Come, wife,"" said uncle John, ""he's an orphan, poor chap. An orphan is

kin to every one.""



She was softened directly, for she had much kindness in her, although

this evening she had been so much put out.



""There's no place for him but with Jack and Dick. We've the baby, and

the other three are packed close enough.""



She took Tom up to the little back room, and stopped to talk with him

for a minute or two, for her husband's words had smitten her heart, and

she was sorry for the ungracious reception she had given Tom at first.



""Jack and Dick are never in bed till we come, and it's work enough to

catch them then on fine evenings,"" said she, as she took the candle

away.



Tom tried to speak to God as his mother had taught him, out of the

fulness of his little heart, which was heavy enough that night. He tried

to think how she would have wished him to speak and to do, and when he

felt puzzled with the remembrance of the scene of disorder and anger

which he had seen, he earnestly prayed God would make and keep clear his

path before him. And then he fell asleep.



He had had a long dream of other and happier days, and had thought he

was once more taking a Sunday evening walk with his mother, when he was

roughly wakened up by his cousins.



""I say, lad, you're lying right across the bed. You must get up, and let

Dick and me come in, and then creep into the space that's left.""



Tom got up dizzy and half awake. His cousins got into bed, and then

squabbled about the largest share. It ended in a kicking match, during

which Tom stood shivering by the bedside.



""I'm sure we're pinched enough as it is,"" said Dick at last. ""And why

they've put Tom in with us I can't think. But I'll not stand it. Tom

shan't sleep with us. He may lie on the floor, if he likes. I'll not

hinder him.""



He expected an opposition from Tom, and was rather surprised when he

heard the little fellow quietly lie down, and cover himself as well as

he could with his clothes. After some more quarrelling, Jack and Dick

fell asleep. But in the middle of the night Dick awoke, and heard by

Tom's breathing that he was still awake, and was crying gently.



""What! molly-coddle, crying for a softer bed?"" asked Dick.



""Oh, no--I don't care for that--if--oh! if mother were but alive,""

little Tom sobbed aloud.



""I say,"" said Dick, after a pause. ""There's room at my back, if you'll

creep in. There! don't be afraid--why, how cold you are, lad.""



Dick was sorry for his cousin's loss, but could not speak about it.

However, his kind tone sank into Tom's heart, and he fell asleep once

more.



The three boys all got up at the same time in the morning, but were

not inclined to talk. Jack and Dick put on their clothes as fast as

possible, and ran downstairs; but this was quite a different way of

going on to what Tom had been accustomed. He looked about for some kind

of basin or mug to wash in; there was none--not even a jug of water in

the room. He slipped on a few necessary clothes, and went downstairs,

found a pitcher, and went off to the pump. His cousins, who were playing

in the court, laughed at him, and would not tell him where the soap was

kept: he had to look some minutes before he could find it. Then he went

back to the bedroom; but on entering it from the fresh air, the smell

was so oppressive that he could not endure it. Three people had been

breathing the air all night, and had used up every particle many times

over and over again; and each time that it had been sent out from the

lungs, it was less fit than before to be breathed again. They had not

felt how poisonous it was while they stayed in it; they had only felt

tired and unrefreshed, with a dull headache; but now that Tom came back

again into it, he could not mistake its oppressive nature. He went to

the window to try and open it. It was what people call a ""Yorkshire

light,"" where you know one-half has to be pushed on one side. It was

very stiff, for it had not been opened for a long time. Tom pushed

against it with all his might; at length it gave way with a jerk; and

the shake sent out a cracked pane, which fell on the floor in a hundred

little bits. Tom was sadly frightened when he saw what he had done. He

would have been sorry to have done mischief at any time, but he had seen

enough of his aunt the evening before to find out that she was sharp,

and hasty, and cross; and it was hard to have to begin the first day in

his new home by getting into a scrape. He sat down on the bedside, and

began to cry. But the morning air blowing in upon him, refreshed him,

and made him feel stronger. He grew braver as he washed himself in the

pure, cold water. ""She can't be cross with me longer than a day; by

to-night it will be all over; I can bear it for a day.""



Dick came running upstairs for something he had forgotten.



""My word, Tom! but you'll catch it!"" exclaimed he, when he saw the

broken window. He was half pleased at the event, and half sorry for Tom.

""Mother did so beat Jack last week for throwing a stone right through

the window downstairs. He kept out of the way till night, but she was on

the look-out for him, and as soon as she saw him, she caught hold of him

and gave it him. Eh! Tom, I would not be you for a deal!""



Tom began to cry again at this account of his aunt's anger; Dick became

more and more sorry for him.



""I'll tell thee what; we'll go down and say it was a lad in yon

back-yard throwing stones, and that one went smack through the window.

I've got one in my pocket that will just do to show.""



""No,"" said Tom, suddenly stopping crying. ""I dare not do that.""



""Daren't! Why you'll have to dare much more if you go down and face

mother without some such story.""



""No! I shan't. I shan't have to dare God's anger. Mother taught me to

fear that; she said I need never be really afraid of aught else. Just be

quiet, Dick, while I say my prayers.""



Dick watched his little cousin kneel down by the bed, and bury his face

in the clothes; he did not say any set prayer (which Dick was accustomed

to think was the only way of praying), but Tom seemed, by the low murmuring

which Dick heard, to be talking to a dear friend; and though at first he

sobbed and cried, as he asked for help and strength, yet when he got up,

his face looked calm and bright, and he spoke quietly as he said to

Dick, ""Now I'm ready to go and tell aunt.""



""Aunt"" meanwhile had missed her pitcher and her soap, and was in no

good-tempered mood when Tom came to make his confession. She had been

hindered in her morning's work by his taking her things away; and now he

was come to tell her of the pane being broken and that it must be

mended, and money must go all for a child's nonsense.



She gave him (as he had been led to expect) one or two very sharp blows.

Jack and Dick looked on with curiosity, to see how he would take it;

Jack, at any rate, expecting a hearty crying from ""softy"" (Jack himself

had cried loudly at his last beating), but Tom never shed a tear, though

his face did go very red, and his mouth did grow set with the pain. But

what struck the boys more even than his being ""hard"" in bearing such

blows, was his quietness afterwards. He did not grumble loudly, as Jack

would have done, nor did he turn sullen, as was Dick's custom; but the

minute afterwards he was ready to run an errand for his aunt; nor did he

make any mention of the hard blows, when his uncle came in to breakfast,

as his aunt had rather expected he would. She was glad he did not, for

she knew her husband would have been displeased to know how early she

had begun to beat his orphan nephew. So she almost felt grateful to Tom

for his silence, and certainly began to be sorry she had struck him so

hard.



Poor Tom! he did not know that his cousins were beginning to respect

him, nor that his aunt was learning to like him; and he felt very lonely

and desolate that first morning. He had nothing to do. Jack went to work

at the factory; and Dick went grumbling to school. Tom wondered if he

was to go to school again, but he did not like to ask. He sat on a

little stool, as much out of his terrible aunt's way as he could. She

had her youngest child, a little girl of about a year and a half old,

crawling about on the floor. Tom longed to play with her; but he was not

sure how far his aunt would like it. But he kept smiling at her, and

doing every little thing he could to attract her attention and make her

come to him. At last she was coaxed to come upon his knee. His aunt saw

it, and though she did not speak, she did not look displeased. He did

everything he could think of to amuse little Annie; and her mother was

very glad to have her attended to. When Annie grew sleepy, she still

kept fast hold of one of Tom's fingers in her little, round, soft hand,

and he began to know the happy feeling of loving somebody again. Only

the night before, when his cousins had made him get out of bed, he had

wondered if he should live to be an old man, and never have anybody to

love all that long time; but now his heart felt quite warm to the little

thing that lay on his lap.



""She'll tire you, Tom,"" said her mother, ""you'd better let me put her

down in the cot.""



""Oh, no!"" said he, ""please don't! I like so much to have her here."" He

never moved, though she lay very heavy on his arm, for fear of wakening

her.



When she did rouse up, his aunt said, ""Thank you, Tom. I've got my work

done rarely with you for a nurse. Now take a run in the yard, and play

yourself a bit.""



His aunt was learning something, and Tom was teaching, though they would

both have been very much surprised to hear it. Whenever, in a family,

every one is selfish, and (as it is called) ""stands up for his own

rights,"" there are no feelings of gratitude; the gracefulness of ""thanks""

is never called for; nor can there be any occasion for thoughtfulness

for others when those others are sure to get the start in thinking for

themselves, and taking care of number one. Tom's aunt had never had to

remind Jack or Dick to go out to play. They were ready enough to see

after their own pleasures.



Well! dinner-time came, and all the family gathered to the meal. It

seemed to be a scramble who should be helped first, and cry out for the

best pieces. Tom looked very red. His aunt in her new-born liking for

him, helped him early to what she thought he would like. But he did not

begin to eat. It had been his mother's custom to teach her little son

to say a simple ""grace"" with her before they began their dinner. He

expected his uncle to follow the same observance; and waited. Then he

felt very hot and shy; but, thinking that it was right to say it, he

put away his shyness, and very quietly, but very solemnly said the old

accustomed sentence of thanksgiving. Jack burst out laughing when he had

done; for which Jack's father gave him a sharp rap and a sharp word,

which made him silent through the rest of the dinner. But, excepting

Jack, who was angry, I think all the family were the happier for having

listened reverently (if with some surprise) to Tom's thanksgiving. They

were not an ill-disposed set of people, but wanted thoughtfulness in

their every-day life; that sort of thoughtfulness which gives order to a

home, and makes a wise and holy spirit of love the groundwork of order.



From that first day Tom never went back in the regard he began then to

win. He was useful to his aunt, and patiently bore her hasty ways, until

for very shame she left off being hasty with one who was always so meek

and mild. His uncle sometimes said he was more like a girl than a boy,

as was to be looked for from being brought up for so many years by a

woman; but that was the greatest fault he ever had to find with him; and

in spite of it, he really respected him for the very qualities which are

most truly ""manly;"" for the courage with which he dared to do what was

right, and the quiet firmness with which he bore many kinds of pain. As

for little Annie, her friendship and favour and love were the delight of

Tom's heart. He did not know how much the others were growing to like

him, but Annie showed it in every way, and he loved her in return most

dearly. Dick soon found out how useful Tom could be to him in his

lessons; for though older than his cousin, Master Dick was a regular

dunce, and had never even wished to learn till Tom came; and long before

Jack could be brought to acknowledge it, Dick maintained that ""Tom had a

great deal of pluck in him, though it was not of Jack's kind.""



Now I shall jump another year, and tell you a very little about the

household twelve months after Tom had entered it. I said above that his

aunt had learned to speak less crossly to one who was always gentle

after her scoldings. By-and-by her ways to all became less hasty and

passionate, for she grew ashamed of speaking to any one in an angry way

before Tom; he always looked so sad and sorry to hear her. She has also

spoken to him sometimes about his mother; at first because she thought

he would like it; but latterly because she became really interested to

hear of her ways; and Tom being an only child, and his mother's friend

and companion, has been able to tell her of many household arts of

comfort, which coming quite unconscious of any purpose, from the lips of

a child, have taught her many things which she would have been too proud

to learn from an older person. Her husband is softened by the additional

cleanliness and peace of his home. He does not now occasionally take

refuge in a public-house, to get out of the way of noisy children, an

unswept hearth, and a scolding wife. Once when Tom was ill for a day or

two, his uncle missed the accustomed grace, and began to say it himself.

He is now the person to say ""Silence, boys;"" and then to ask the blessing

on the meal. It makes them gather round the table, instead of sitting

down here and there in the comfortless, unsociable way they used to do.

Tom and Dick go to school together now, and Dick is getting on famously,

and will soon be able to help his next brother over his lessons, as Tom

has helped him.



Even Jack has been heard to acknowledge that Tom has ""pluck"" in him; and

as ""pluck"" in Jack's mind is a short way of summing up all the virtues,

he has lately become very fond of his cousin. Tom does not think about

happiness, but is happy; and I think we may hope that he, and the

household among whom he is adopted, will go ""from strength to strength.""



Now do you not see how much happier this family are from the one

circumstance of a little child's coming among them? Could money have

made one-tenth part of this real and increasing happiness? I think you

will all say no. And yet Tom was no powerful person; he was not clever;

he was very friendless at first; but he was loving and good; and on

those two qualities, which any of us may have if we try, the blessing of

God lies in rich abundance.









BESSY'S TROUBLES AT HOME.





""Well, mother, I've got you a Southport ticket,"" said Bessy Lee, as she

burst into a room where a pale, sick woman lay dressed on the outside of

a bed. ""Aren't you glad?"" asked she, as her mother moved uneasily, but

did not speak.



""Yes, dear, I'm very thankful to you; but your sudden coming in has made

my heart flutter so, I'm ready to choke.""



Poor Bessy's eyes filled with tears: but, it must be owned, they were

tears half of anger. She had taken such pains, ever since the doctor

said that Southport was the only thing for her mother, to get her an

order from some subscriber to the charity; and she had rushed to her, in

the full glow of success, and now her mother seemed more put out by the

noise she had made on coming in, than glad to receive the news she had

brought.



Mrs. Lee took her hand and tried to speak, but, as she said, she was

almost choked with the palpitation at her heart.



""You think it very silly in me, dear, to be so easily startled; but it

is not altogether silliness; it is I am so weak that every little noise

gives me quite a fright. I shall be better, love, please God, when I

come back from Southport. I am so glad you've got the order, for you've

taken a deal of pains about it."" Mrs. Lee sighed.



""Don't you want to go?"" asked Bessy, rather sadly. ""You always seem so

sorrowful and anxious when we talk about it.""



""It's partly my being ailing that makes me anxious, I know,"" said Mrs.

Lee. ""But it seems as if so many things might happen while I was away.""



Bessy felt a little impatient. Young people in strong health can hardly

understand the fears that beset invalids. Bessy was a kind-hearted girl,

but rather headstrong, and just now a little disappointed. She forgot

that her mother had had to struggle hard with many cares ever since she

had been left a widow, and that her illness now had made her nervous.



""What nonsense, mother! What can happen? I can take care of the house

and the little ones, and Tom and Jem can take care of themselves. What

is to happen?""



""Jenny may fall into the fire,"" murmured Mrs. Lee, who found little

comfort in being talked to in this way. ""Or your father's watch may be

stolen while you are in, talking with the neighbours, or----""



""Now come, mother, you know I've had the charge of Jenny ever since

father died, and you began to go out washing--and I'll lock father's

watch up in the box in our room.""



""Then Tom and Jem won't know at what time to go to the factory. Besides,

Bessy,"" said she, raising herself up, ""they're are but young lads, and

there's a deal of temptation to take them away from their homes, if

their homes are not comfortable and pleasant to them. It's that, more

than anything, I've been fretting about all the time I've been

ill,--that I've lost the power of making this house the cleanest and

brightest place they know. But it's no use fretting,"" said she, falling

back weakly upon the bed and sighing. ""I must leave it in God's hands.

He raiseth up and He bringeth low.""



Bessy stood silent for a minute or two. Then she said, ""Well, mother, I

will try to make home comfortable for the lads, if you'll but keep your

mind easy, and go off to Southport quiet and cheerful.""



""I'll try,"" said Mrs. Lee, taking hold of Bessy's hand, and looking up

thankfully in her face.



The next Wednesday she set off, leaving home with a heavy heart, which,

however, she struggled against, and tried to make more faithful. But she

wished her three weeks at Southport were over.



Tom and Jem were both older than Bessy, and she was fifteen. Then came

Bill and Mary and little Jenny. They were all good children, and all had

faults. Tom and Jem helped to support the family by their earnings at

the factory, and gave up their wages very cheerfully for this purpose,

to their mother, who, however, insisted on a little being put by every

week in the savings' bank. It was one of her griefs now that, when the

doctor ordered her some expensive delicacy in the way of diet during her

illness (a thing which she persisted in thinking she could have done

without), her boys had gone and taken their money out in order to

procure it for her. The article in question did not cost one quarter

of the amount of their savings, but they had put off returning the

remainder into the bank, saying the doctor's bill had yet to be paid,

and that it seemed so silly to be always taking money in and out. But

meanwhile Mrs. Lee feared lest it should be spent, and begged them to

restore it to the savings' bank. This had not been done when she left

for Southport. Bill and Mary went to school. Little Jenny was the

darling of all, and toddled about at home, having been her sister

Bessy's especial charge when all went on well, and the mother used to

go out to wash.



Mrs. Lee, however, had always made a point of giving all her children

who were at home a comfortable breakfast at seven, before she set out

to her day's work; and she prepared the boys' dinner ready for Bessy

to warm for them. At night, too, she was anxious to be at home as soon

after her boys as she could; and many of her employers respected her

wish, and, finding her hard-working and conscientious, took care to set

her at liberty early in the evening.



Bessy felt very proud and womanly when she returned home from seeing

her mother off by the railway. She looked round the house with a new

feeling of proprietorship, and then went to claim little Jenny from the

neighbour's where she had been left while Bessy had gone to the station.

They asked her to stay and have a bit of chat; but she replied that she

could not, for that it was near dinner-time, and she refused the

invitation that was then given her to go in some evening. She was full

of good plans and resolutions.



That afternoon she took Jenny and went to her teacher's to borrow a

book, which she meant to ask one of her brothers to read to her in the

evenings while she worked. She knew that it was a book which Jem would

like, for though she had never read it, one of her school-fellows had

told her it was all about the sea, and desert islands, and cocoanut-trees,

just the things that Jem liked to hear about. How happy they would all

be this evening.



She hurried Jenny off to bed before her brothers came home; Jenny did

not like to go so early, and had to be bribed and coaxed to give up the

pleasure of sitting on brother Tom's knee; and when she was in bed, she

could not go to sleep, and kept up a little whimper of distress. Bessy

kept calling out to her, now in gentle, now in sharp tones, as she made

the hearth clean and bright against her brothers' return, as she settled

Bill and Mary to their next day's lessons, and got her work ready for a

happy evening.



Presently the elder boys came in.



""Where's Jenny?"" asked Tom, the first thing.



""I've put her to bed,"" said Bessy. ""I've borrowed a book for you to read

to me while I darn the stockings; and it was time for Jenny to go.""



""Mother never puts her to bed so soon,"" said Tom, dissatisfied.



""But she'd be so in the way of any quietness over our reading,"" said

Bessy.



""I don't want to read,"" said Tom; ""I want Jenny to sit on my knee, as

she always does, while I eat my supper.""



""Tom, Tom, dear Tom!"" called out little Jenny, who had heard his voice,

and, perhaps, a little of the conversation.



Tom made but two steps upstairs, and re-appeared with Jenny in his arms,

in her night-clothes. The little girl looked at Bessy half triumphant

and half afraid. Bessy did not speak, but she was evidently very much

displeased. Tom began to eat his porridge with Jenny on his knee. Bessy

sat in sullen silence; she was vexed with Tom, vexed with Jenny, and

vexed with Jem, to gratify whose taste for reading travels she had

especially borrowed this book, which he seemed to care so little about.

She brooded over her fancied wrongs, ready to fall upon the first person

who might give the slightest occasion for anger. It happened to be poor

little Jenny, who, by some awkward movement, knocked over the jug of

milk, and made a great splash on Bessy's clean white floor.



""Never mind!"" said Tom, as Jenny began to cry. ""I like my porridge as

well without milk as with it.""



""Oh, never mind!"" said Bessy, her colour rising, and her breath growing

shorter. ""Never mind dirtying anything, Jenny; it's only giving trouble

to Bessy! But I'll make you mind,"" continued she, as she caught a glance

of intelligence peep from Jem's eyes to Tom; and she slapped Jenny's

head. The moment she had done it she was sorry for it; she could have

beaten herself now with the greatest pleasure for having given way to

passion; for she loved little Jenny dearly, and she saw that she really

had hurt her. But Jem, with his loud, deep, ""For shame, Bessy!"" and Tom,

with his excess of sympathy with his little sister's wrongs, checked

back any expression which Bessy might have uttered of sorrow and regret.

She sat there ten times more unhappy than she had been before the

accident, hardening her heart to the reproaches of her conscience, yet

feeling most keenly that she had been acting wrongly. No one seemed to

notice her; this was the evening she had planned and arranged for so

busily; and the others, who never thought about it at all, were all

quiet and happy, at least in outward appearance, while she was so

wretched. By-and-by, she felt the touch of a little soft hand stealing

into her own. She looked to see who it was; it was Mary, who till now

had been busy learning her lessons, but uncomfortably conscious of the

discordant spirit prevailing in the room; and who had at last ventured

up to Bessy, as the one who looked the most unhappy, to express, in her

own little gentle way, her sympathy in sorrow. Mary was not a quick

child; she was plain and awkward in her ways, and did not seem to have

many words in which to tell her feelings, but she was very tender and

loving, and submitted meekly and humbly to the little slights and

rebuffs she often met with for her stupidity.



""Dear Bessy! good night!"" said she, kissing her sister; and, at the soft

kiss, Bessy's eyes filled with tears, and her heart began to melt.



""Jenny,"" continued Mary, going to the little spoilt, wilful girl, ""will

you come to bed with me, and I'll tell you stories about school, and

sing you my songs as I undress? Come, little one!"" said she, holding out

her arms. Jenny was tempted by this speech, and went off to bed in a

more reasonable frame of mind than any one had dared to hope.



And now all seemed clear and open for the reading, but each was too

proud to propose it. Jem, indeed, seemed to have forgotten the book

altogether, he was so busy whittling away at a piece of wood. At last

Tom, by a strong effort, said, ""Bessy, mayn't we have the book now?""



""No!"" said Jem, ""don't begin reading, for I must go out and try and make

Ned Bates give me a piece of ash-wood--deal is just good for nothing.""



""Oh!"" said Bessy, ""I don't want any one to read this book who does not

like it. But I know mother would be better pleased if you were stopping

at home quiet, rather than rambling to Ned Bates's at this time of

night.""



""I know what mother would like as well as you, and I'm not going to be

preached to by a girl,"" said Jem, taking up his cap and going out. Tom

yawned and went up to bed. Bessy sat brooding over the evening.



""So much as I thought and I planned! I'm sure I tried to do what was

right, and make the boys happy at home. And yet nothing has happened

as I wanted it to do. Every one has been so cross and contrary. Tom

would take Jenny up when she ought to have been in bed. Jem did not

care a straw for this book that I borrowed on purpose for him, but sat

laughing. I saw, though he did not think I did, when all was going

provoking and vexatious. Mary--no! Mary was a help and a comfort, as she

always is, I think, though she is so stupid over her book. Mary always

contrives to get people right, and to have her own way somehow; and yet

I'm sure she does not take half the trouble I do to please people.""



Jem came back soon, disappointed because Ned Bates was out, and could

not give him any ash-wood. Bessy said it served him right for going at

that time of night, and the brother and sister spoke angrily to each

other all the way upstairs, and parted without even saying good-night.

Jenny was asleep when Bessy entered the bedroom which she shared with

her sisters and her mother; but she saw Mary's wakeful eyes looking at

her as she came in.



""Oh, Mary,"" said she, ""I wish mother was back. The lads would mind her,

and now I see they'll just go and get into mischief to spite and plague

me.""



""I don't think it's for that,"" said Mary, softly. ""Jem did want that

ash-wood, I know, for he told me in the morning he didn't think that

deal would do. He wants to make a wedge to keep the window from rattling

so on windy nights; you know how that fidgets mother.""



The next day, little Mary, on her way to school, went round by Ned

Bates's to beg a piece of wood for her brother Jem; she brought it home

to him at dinner-time, and asked him to be so good as to have everything

ready for a quiet whittling at night, while Tom or Bessy read aloud. She

told Jenny she would make haste with her lessons, so as to be ready to

come to bed early, and talk to her about school (a grand, wonderful

place, in Jenny's eyes), and thus Mary quietly and gently prepared for a

happy evening, by attending to the kind of happiness for which every one

wished.



While Mary had thus been busy preparing for a happy evening, Bessy had

been spending part of the afternoon at a Mrs. Foster's, a neighbour of

her mother's, and a very tidy, industrious old widow. Mrs. Foster earned

part of her livelihood by working for the shops where knitted work of

all kinds is to be sold; and Bessy's attention was caught, almost as

soon as she went in, by a very gay piece of wool-knitting, in a new

stitch, that was to be used as a warm covering for the feet. After

admiring its pretty looks, Bessy thought how useful it might be to her

mother; and when Mrs. Foster heard this, she offered to teach Bessy how

to do it. But where were the wools to come from? Those which Mrs. Foster

used were provided her by the shop; and she was a very poor woman--too

poor to make presents, though rich enough (as we all are) to give help

of many other kinds, and willing too to do what she could (which some of

us are not).



The two sat perplexed. ""How much did you say it would cost?"" said Bessy

at last; as if the article was likely to have become cheaper, since she

asked the question before.



""Well! it's sure to be more than two shillings if it's German wool. You

might get it for eighteenpence if you could be content with English.""



""But I've not got eighteenpence,"" said Bessy, gloomily.



""I could lend it you,"" said Mrs. Foster, ""if I was sure of having it

back before Monday. But it's part of my rent-money. Could you make sure,

do you think?""



""Oh, yes!"" said Bessy, eagerly. ""At least I'd try. But perhaps I had

better not take it, for after all I don't know where I could get it.

What Tom and Jem earn is little enough for the house, now that mother's

washing is cut off.""



""They are good, dutiful lads, to give it to their mother,"" said Mrs.

Foster, sighing: for she thought of her own boys, that had left her in

her old age to toil on, with faded eyesight and weakened strength.



""Oh! but mother makes them each keep a shilling out of it for

themselves,"" said Bessy, in a complaining tone, for she wanted money,

and was inclined to envy any one who possessed it.



""That's right enough,"" said Mrs. Foster. ""They that earn it should have

some of the power over it.""



""But about this wool; this eighteenpence! I wish I was a boy and could

earn money. I wish mother would have let me go to work in the factory.""



""Come now, Bessy, I can have none of that nonsense. Thy mother knows

what's best for thee; and I'm not going to hear thee complain of what

she has thought right. But may be, I can help you to a way of gaining

eighteenpence. Mrs. Scott at the worsted shop told me that she should

want some one to clean on Saturday; now you're a good strong girl, and

can do a woman's work if you've a mind. Shall I say you will go? and

then I don't mind if I lend you my eighteenpence. You'll pay me before I

want my rent on Monday.""



""Oh! thank you, dear Mrs. Foster,"" said Bessy. ""I can scour as well as

any woman, mother often says so; and I'll do my best on Saturday; they

shan't blame you for having spoken up for me.""



""No, Bessy, they won't, I'm sure, if you do your best. You're a good

sharp girl for your years.""



Bessy lingered for some time, hoping that Mrs. Foster would remember her

offer of lending her the money; but finding that she had quite forgotten

it, she ventured to remind the kind old woman. That it was nothing but

forgetfulness, was evident from the haste with which Mrs. Foster bustled

up to her tea-pot and took from it the money required.



""You're as welcome to it as can be, Bessy, as long as I'm sure of its

being repaid by Monday. But you're in a mighty hurry about this coverlet,""

continued she, as she saw Bessy put on her bonnet and prepare to go out.

""Stay, you must take patterns, and go to the right shop in St. Mary's

Gate. Why, your mother won't be back this three weeks, child.""



""No. But I can't abide waiting, and I want to set to it before it is

dark; and you'll teach me the stitch, won't you, when I come back with

the wools? I won't be half an hour away.""



But Mary and Bill had to ""abide waiting"" that afternoon; for though the

neighbour at whose house the key was left could let them into the house,

there was no supper ready for them on their return from school; even

Jenny was away spending the afternoon with a playfellow; the fire was

nearly out, the milk had been left at a neighbour's; altogether home was

very comfortless to the poor tired children, and Bill grumbled terribly;

Mary's head ached, and the very tones of her brother's voice, as he

complained, gave her pain; and for a minute she felt inclined to sit

down and cry. But then she thought of many little sayings which she had

heard from her teacher--such as ""Never complain of what you can cure,""

""Bear and forbear,"" and several other short sentences of a similar

description. So she began to make up the fire, and asked Bill to fetch

some chips; and when he gave her the gruff answer, that he did not see

any use in making a fire when there was nothing to cook by it, she went

herself and brought the wood without a word of complaint.



Presently Bill said, ""Here! you lend me those bellows; you're not

blowing it in the right way; girls never do!"" He found out that Mary was

wise in making a bright fire ready; for before the blowing was ended,

the neighbour with whom the milk had been left brought it in, and little

handy Mary prepared the porridge as well as the mother herself could

have done. They had just ended when Bessy came in almost breathless; for

she had suddenly remembered, in the middle of her knitting-lesson, that

Bill and Mary must be at home from school.



""Oh!"" she said, ""that's right. I have so hurried myself! I was afraid

the fire would be out. Where's Jenny? You were to have called for her,

you know, as you came from school. Dear! how stupid you are, Mary. I am

sure I told you over and over again. Now don't cry, silly child. The

best thing you can do is to run off back again for her.""



""But my lessons, Bessy. They are so bad to learn. It's tables day

to-morrow,"" pleaded Mary.



""Nonsense; tables are as easy as can be. I can say up to sixteen times

sixteen in no time.""



""But you know, Bessy, I'm very stupid, and my head aches so to-night!""



""Well! the air will do it good. Really, Mary, I would go myself, only

I'm so busy; and you know Bill is too careless, mother says, to fetch

Jenny through the streets; and besides they would quarrel, and you can

always manage Jenny.""



Mary sighed, and went away to bring her sister home. Bessy sat down to

her knitting. Presently Bill came up to her with some question about his

lesson. She told him the answer without looking at the book; it was all

wrong, and made nonsense; but Bill did not care to understand what he

learnt, and went on saying, ""Twelve inches make one shilling,"" as

contentedly as if it were right.



Mary brought Jenny home quite safely. Indeed, Mary always did succeed in

everything, except learning her lessons well; and sometimes, if the

teacher could have known how many tasks fell upon the willing, gentle

girl at home, she would not have thought that poor Mary was slow or a

dunce; and such thoughts would come into the teacher's mind sometimes,

although she fully appreciated Mary's sweetness and humility of

disposition.



To-night she tried hard at her tables, and all to no use. Her head

ached so, she could not remember them, do what she would. She longed to

go to her mother, whose cool hands around her forehead always seemed to

do her so much good, and whose soft, loving words were such a help

to her when she had to bear pain. She had arranged so many plans for

to-night, and now all were deranged by Bessy's new fancy for knitting.

But Mary did not see this in the plain, clear light in which I have put

it before you. She only was sorry that she could not make haste with her

lessons, as she had promised Jenny, who was now upbraiding her with the

non-fulfilment of her words. Jenny was still up when Tom and Jem came

in. They spoke sharply to Bessy for not having their porridge ready; and

while she was defending herself, Mary, even at the risk of imperfect

lessons, began to prepare the supper for her brothers. She did it all

so quietly, that, almost before they were aware, it was ready for them;

and Bessy, suddenly ashamed of herself, and touched by Mary's quiet

helpfulness, bent down and kissed her, as once more she settled to the

never-ending difficulty of her lesson.



Mary threw her arms round Bessy's neck, and began to cry, for this little

mark of affection went to her heart; she had been so longing for a word

or a sign of love in her suffering.



""Come, Molly,"" said Jem, ""don't cry like a baby;"" but he spoke very

kindly. ""What's the matter? the old headache come back? Never mind. Go

to bed, and it will be better in the morning.""



""But I can't go to bed. I don't know my lesson!"" Mary looked happier,

though the tears were in her eyes.



""I know mine,"" said Bill, triumphantly.



""Come here,"" said Jem. ""There! I've time enough to whittle away at this

before mother comes back. Now let's see this difficult lesson.""



Jem's help soon enabled Mary to conquer her lesson; but, meanwhile, Jenny

and Bill had taken to quarrelling in spite of Bessy's scolding,

administered in small sharp doses, as she looked up from her

all-absorbing knitting.



""Well,"" said Tom, ""with this riot on one side, and this dull lesson on

the other, and Bessy as cross as can be in the midst, I can understand

what makes a man go out to spend his evenings from home.""



Bessy looked up, suddenly wakened up to a sense of the danger which her

mother had dreaded.



Bessy thought it was very fortunate that it fell on a Saturday, of

all days in the week, that Mrs. Scott wanted her; for Mary would be at

home, who could attend to the household wants of everybody; and so she

satisfied her conscience at leaving the post of duty that her mother had

assigned to her, and that she had promised to fulfil. She was so eager

about her own plans that she did not consider this; she did not consider

at all, or else I think she would have seen many things to which she

seemed to be blind now. When were Mary's lessons for Monday to be

learnt? Bessy knew as well as we do, that lesson-learning was hard work

to Mary. If Mary worked as hard as she could after morning school she

could hardly get the house cleaned up bright and comfortable before

her brothers came home from the factory, which ""loosed"" early on the

Saturday afternoon; and if pails of water, chairs heaped up one on

the other, and tables put topsy-turvy on the dresser, were the most

prominent objects in the house-place, there would be no temptation for

the lads to stay at home; besides which, Mary, tired and weary (however

gentle she might be), would not be able to give the life to the evening

that Bessy, a clever, spirited girl, near their own age, could easily

do, if she chose to be interested and sympathising in what they had to

tell. But Bessy did not think of all this. What she did think about was

the pleasant surprise she should give her mother by the warm and pretty

covering for her feet, which she hoped to present her with on her return

home. And if she had done the duties she was pledged to on her mother's

departure first, if they had been compatible with her plan of being a

whole day absent from home, in order to earn the money for the wools,

the project of the surprise would have been innocent and praiseworthy.



Bessy prepared everything for dinner before she left home that Saturday

morning. She made a potato-pie all ready for putting in the oven; she

was very particular in telling Mary what was to be cleaned, and how it

was all to be cleaned; and then she kissed the children, and ran off to

Mrs. Scott's. Mary was rather afraid of the responsibility thrust upon

her; but still she was pleased that Bessy could trust her to do so much.

She took Jenny to the ever-useful neighbour, as she and Bill went to

school; but she was rather frightened when Mrs. Jones began to grumble

about these frequent visits of the child.



""I was ready enough to take care of the wench when thy mother was ill;

there was reason for that. And the child is a nice child enough, when

she is not cross; but still there are some folks, it seems, who, if you

give them an inch, will take an ell. Where's Bessy, that she can't mind

her own sister?""



""Gone out charing,"" said Mary, clasping the little hand in hers tighter,

for she was afraid of Mrs. Jones's anger.



""I could go out charing every day in the week if I'd the face to trouble

other folks with my children,"" said Mrs. Jones, in a surly tone.



""Shall I take her back, ma'am?"" said Mary, timidly, though she knew this

would involve her staying away from school, and being blamed by the dear

teacher. But Mrs. Jones growled worse than she bit, this time at least.



""No,"" said she, ""you may leave her with me. I suppose she's had her

breakfast?""



""Yes; and I'll fetch her away as soon as ever I can after twelve.""



If Mary had been one to consider the hardships of her little lot, she

might have felt this morning's occurrence as one;--that she, who dreaded

giving trouble to anybody, and was painfully averse from asking any

little favour for herself, should be the very one on whom it fell to

presume upon another person's kindness. But Mary never did think of any

hardships; they seemed the natural events of life, and as if it was

fitting and proper that she, who managed things badly, and was such a

dunce, should be blamed. Still she was rather flurried by Mrs. Jones's

scolding; and almost wished that she had taken Jenny home again. Her

lessons were not well said, owing to the distraction of her mind.



When she went for Jenny she found that Mrs. Jones, repenting of her

sharp words, had given the little girl bread and treacle, and made her

very comfortable; so much so that Jenny was not all at once ready to

leave her little playmates, and when once she had set out on the road,

she was in no humour to make haste. Mary thought of the potato-pie and

her brothers, and could almost have cried, as Jenny, heedless of her

sister's entreaties, would linger at the picture-shops.



""I shall be obliged to go and leave you, Jenny! I must get dinner

ready.""



""I don't care,"" said Jenny. ""I don't want any dinner, and I can come

home quite well by myself.""



Mary half longed to give her a fright, it was so provoking. But she

thought of her mother, who was so anxious always about Jenny, and she

did not do it. She kept patiently trying to attract her onwards, and

at last they were at home. Mary stirred up the fire, which was to all

appearance quite black; it blazed up, but the oven was cold. She put the

pie in, and blew the fire; but the paste was quite white and soft when

her brothers came home, eager and hungry.



""Oh! Mary, what a manager you are!"" said Tom. ""Any one else would have

remembered and put the pie in in time.""



Mary's eyes filled full of tears; but she did not try to justify

herself. She went on blowing, till Jem took the bellows, and kindly

told her to take off her bonnet, and lay the cloth. Jem was always kind.

He gave Tom the best baked side of the pie, and quietly took the side

himself where the paste was little better than dough, and the potatoes

quite hard; and when he caught Mary's little anxious face watching him,

as he had to leave part of his dinner untasted, he said, ""Mary, I should

like this pie warmed up for supper; there is nothing so good as

potato-pie made hot the second time.""



Tom went off saying, ""Mary, I would not have you for a wife on any

account. Why, my dinner would never be ready, and your sad face would

take away my appetite if it were.""



But Jem kissed her and said, ""Never mind, Mary! you and I will live

together, old maid and old bachelor.""



So she could set to with spirit to her cleaning, thinking there never

was such a good brother as Jem; and as she dwelt upon his perfections,

she thought who it was who had given her such a good, kind brother, and

felt her heart full of gratitude to Him. She scoured and cleaned in

right-down earnest. Jenny helped her for some time, delighted to be

allowed to touch and lift things. But then she grew tired; and Bill was

out of doors; so Mary had to do all by herself, and grew very nervous

and frightened, lest all should not be finished and tidy against Tom

came home. And the more frightened she grew, the worse she got on. Her

hands trembled, and things slipped out of them; and she shook so, she

could not lift heavy pieces of furniture quickly and sharply; and in

the middle the clock struck the hour for her brothers' return, when all

ought to have been tidy and ready for tea. She gave it up in despair,

and began to cry.



""Oh, Bessy, Bessy! why did you go away? I have tried hard, and I cannot

do it,"" said she aloud, as if Bessy could hear.



""Dear Mary, don't cry,"" said Jenny, suddenly coming away from her play.

""I'll help you. I am very strong. I can do anything. I can lift that pan

off the fire.""



The pan was full of boiling water, ready for Mary. Jenny took hold of

the handle, and dragged it along the bar over the fire. Mary sprung

forwards in terror to stop the little girl. She never knew how it was,

but the next moment her arm and side were full of burning pain, which

turned her sick and dizzy, and Jenny was crying passionately beside her.



""Oh, Mary! Mary! Mary! my hand is so scalded. What shall I do? I cannot

bear it. It's all about my feet on the ground."" She kept shaking her

hand to cool it by the action of the air. Mary thought that she herself

was dying, so acute and terrible was the pain; she could hardly keep

from screaming out aloud; but she felt that if she once began she could

not stop herself, so she sat still, moaning, and the tears running down

her face like rain. ""Go, Jenny,"" said she, ""and tell some one to come.""



""I can't, I can't, my hand hurts so,"" said Jenny. But she flew wildly

out of the house the next minute, crying out, ""Mary is dead. Come, come,

come!"" For Mary could bear it no longer; but had fainted away, and looked,

indeed, like one that was dead. Neighbours flocked in; and one ran for

a doctor. In five minutes Tom and Jem came home. What a home it seems!

People they hardly knew standing in the house-place, which looked as if

it had never been cleaned--all was so wet, and in such disorder, and

dirty with the trampling of many feet; Jenny still crying passionately,

but half comforted at being at present the only authority as to how the

affair happened; and faint moans from the room upstairs, where some women

were cutting the clothes off poor Mary, preparatory for the doctor's

inspection. Jem said directly, ""Some one go straight to Mrs. Scott's,

and fetch our Bessy. Her place is here, with Mary.""



And then he civilly, but quietly, dismissed all the unnecessary and

useless people, feeling sure that in case of any kind of illness, quiet

was the best thing. Then he went upstairs.



Mary's face was scarlet now with violent pain; but she smiled a little

through her tears at seeing Jem. As for him, he cried outright.



""I don't think it was anybody's fault, Jem,"" said she, softly. ""It was

very heavy to lift.""



""Are you in great pain, dear?"" asked Jem, in a whisper.



""I think I'm killed, Jem. I do think I am. And I did so want to see

mother again.""



""Nonsense!"" said the woman who had been helping Mary. For, as she said

afterwards, whether Mary died or lived, crying was a bad thing for her;

and she saw the girl was ready to cry when she thought of her mother,

though she had borne up bravely all the time the clothes were cut off.



Bessy's face, which had been red with hard running, faded to a dead

white when she saw Mary; she looked so shocked and ill that Jem had not

the heart to blame her, although the minute before she came in, he had

been feeling very angry with her. Bessy stood quite still at the foot of

Mary's bed, never speaking a word, while the doctor examined her side

and felt her pulse; only great round tears gathered in her eyes, and

rolled down her cheeks, as she saw Mary quiver with pain. Jem followed

the doctor downstairs. Then Bessy went and knelt beside Mary, and wiped

away the tears that were trickling down the little face.



""Is it very bad, Mary?"" asked Bessy.



""Oh yes! yes! if I speak, I shall scream.""



Then Bessy covered her head in the bed-clothes and cried outright.



""I was not cross, was I? I did not mean to be--but I hardly know what I

am saying,"" moaned out little Mary. ""Please forgive me, Bessy, if I was

cross.""



""God forgive me!"" said Bessy, very low. They were the first words she

had spoken since she came home. But there could be no more talking

between the sisters, for now the woman returned who had at first been

assisting Mary. Presently Jem came to the door, and beckoned. Bessy rose

up, and went with, him below. Jem looked very grave, yet not so sad as

he had done before the doctor came. ""He says she must go into the

infirmary. He will see about getting her in.""



""Oh, Jem! I did so want to nurse her myself!"" said Bessy, imploringly.

""It was all my own fault,"" (she choked with crying); ""and I thought I

might do that for her, to make up.""



""My dear Bessy,""--before he had seen Bessy, he had thought he could

never call her ""dear"" again, but now he began--""My dear Bessy, we both

want Mary to get better, don't we? I am sure we do. And we want to take

the best way of making her so, whatever that is; well, then, I think we

must not be considering what we should like best just for ourselves, but

what people, who know as well as doctors do, say is the right way. I

can't remember all that he said; but I'm clear that he told me, all

wounds on the skin required more and better air to heal in than Mary

could have here: and there the doctor will see her twice a day, if need

be.""



Bessy shook her head, but could not speak at first. At last she said,

""Jem, I did so want to do something for her. No one could nurse her as I

should.""



Jem was silent. At last he took Bessy's hand, for he wanted to say

something to her that he was afraid might vex her, and yet that he

thought he ought to say.



""Bessy!"" said he, ""when mother went away, you planned to do all things

right at home, and to make us all happy. I know you did. Now may I tell

you how I think you went wrong? Don't be angry, Bessy.""



""I think I shall never have spirit enough in me to be angry again,"" said

Bessy, humbly and sadly.



""So much the better, dear. But don't over-fret about Mary. The doctor

has good hopes of her, if he can get her into the infirmary. Now, I'm

going on to tell you how I think you got wrong after mother left. You

see, Bessy, you wanted to make us all happy your way--as you liked; just

as you are wanting now to nurse Mary in your way, and as you like. Now,

as far as I can make out, those folks who make home the happiest, are

people who try and find out how others think they could be happy, and

then, if it's not wrong, help them on with their wishes as far as they

can. You know, you wanted us all to listen to your book; and very kind

it was in you to think of it; only, you see, one wanted to whittle, and

another wanted to do this or that, and then you were vexed with us all.

I don't say but what I should have been if I had been in your place, and

planned such a deal for others; only lookers-on always see a deal; and I

saw that if you'd done what poor little Mary did next day, we should all

have been far happier. She thought how she could forward us in our

plans, instead of trying to force a plan of her own on us. She got me my

right sort of wood for whittling, and arranged all nicely to get the

little ones off to bed, so as to get the house quiet, if you wanted some

reading, as she thought you did. And that's the way, I notice, some

folks have of making a happy home. Others may mean just as well, but

they don't hit the thing.""



""I dare say it's true,"" said Bessy. ""But sometimes you all hang about as

if you did not know what to do. And I thought reading travels would just

please you all.""



Jem was touched by Bessy's humble way of speaking, so different from her

usual cheerful, self-confident manner. He answered, ""I know you did,

dear. And many a time we should have been glad enough of it, when we had

nothing to do, as you say.""



""I had promised mother to try and make you all happy, and this is the

end of it!"" said Bessy, beginning to cry afresh.



""But, Bessy! I think you were not thinking of your promise, when you

fixed to go out and char.""



""I thought of earning money.""



""Earning money would not make us happy. We have enough, with care and

management. If you were to have made us happy, you should have been at

home, with a bright face, ready to welcome us; don't you think so, dear

Bessy?""



""I did not want the money for home. I wanted to make mother a present of

such a pretty thing!""



""Poor mother! I am afraid we must send for her home now. And she has

only been three days at Southport!""



""Oh!"" said Bessy, startled by this notion of Jem's; ""don't, don't send

for mother. The doctor did say so much about her going to Southport

being the only thing for her, and I did so try to get her an order! It

will kill her, Jem! indeed it will; you don't know how weak and

frightened she is,--oh, Jem, Jem!""



Jem felt the truth of what his sister was saying. At last, he resolved

to leave the matter for the doctor to decide, as he had attended his

mother, and now knew exactly how much danger there was about Mary. He

proposed to Bessy that they should go and relieve the kind neighbour who

had charge of Mary.



""But you won't send for mother,"" pleaded Bessy; ""if it's the best thing

for Mary, I'll wash up her things to-night, all ready for her to go

into the infirmary. I won't think of myself, Jem.""



""Well! I must speak to the doctor,"" said Jem. ""I must not try and fix

any way just because we wish it, but because it is right.""



All night long, Bessy washed and ironed, and yet was always ready to

attend to Mary when Jem called her. She took Jenny's scalded hand in

charge as well, and bathed it with the lotion the doctor sent; and all

was done so meekly and patiently that even Tom was struck with it, and

admired the change. The doctor came very early. He had prepared

everything for Mary's admission into the infirmary. And Jem consulted

him about sending for his mother home. Bessy sat trembling, awaiting his

answer.



""I am very unwilling to sanction any concealment. And yet, as you say,

your mother is in a very delicate state. It might do her serious harm

if she had any shock. Well! suppose for this once, I take it on myself.

If Mary goes on as I hope, why--well! well! we'll see. Mind that your

mother is told all when she comes home. And if our poor Mary grows

worse--but I'm not afraid of that, with infirmary care and nursing--but

if she does, I'll write to your mother myself, and arrange with a kind

friend I have at Southport all about sending her home. And now,"" said

he, turning suddenly to Bessy, ""tell me what you were doing from home

when this happened. Did not your mother leave you in charge of all at

home?""



""Yes, sir!"" said Bessy, trembling. ""But, sir, I thought I could earn

money to make mother a present!""



""Thought! fiddle-de-dee. I'll tell you what; never you neglect the work

clearly laid out for you by either God or man, to go making work for

yourself, according to your own fancies. God knows what you are most fit

for. Do that. And then wait; if you don't see your next duty clearly.

You will not long be idle in this world, if you are ready for a summons.

Now let me see that you send Mary all clean and tidy to the infirmary.""



Jem was holding Bessy's hand. ""She has washed everything and made it fit

for a queen. Our Bessy worked all night long, and was content to let me

be with Mary (where she wished sore to be), because I could lift her

better, being the stronger.""



""That's right. Even when you want to be of service to others, don't

think how to please yourself.""



I have not much more to tell you about Bessy. This sad accident of

Mary's did her a great deal of good, although it cost her so much sorrow

at first. It taught her several lessons, which it is good for every

woman to learn, whether she is called upon, as daughter, sister, wife,

or mother, to contribute to the happiness of a home. And Mary herself

was hardly more thoughtful and careful to make others happy in their own

way, provided that way was innocent, than was Bessy hereafter. It was a

struggle between her and Mary which could be the least selfish, and do

the duties nearest to them with the most faithfulness and zeal. The

mother stayed at Southport her full time, and came home well and strong.

Then Bessy put her arms round her mother's neck, and told her all--and

far more severely against herself than either the doctor or Jem did,

when they related the same story afterwards.









DISAPPEARANCES.





I am not in the habit of seeing the _Household Words_ regularly; but a

friend, who lately sent me some of the back numbers, recommended me to

read ""all the papers relating to the Detective and Protective Police,""

which I accordingly did--not as the generality of readers have done, as

they appeared week by week, or with pauses between, but consecutively,

as a popular history of the Metropolitan Police; and, as I suppose it

may also be considered, a history of the police force in every large

town in England. When I had ended these papers, I did not feel disposed

to read any others at that time, but preferred falling into a train of

reverie and recollection.



First of all I remembered, with a smile, the unexpected manner in which

a relation of mine was discovered by an acquaintance, who had mislaid or

forgotten Mr. B.'s address. Now my dear cousin, Mr. B., charming as he

is in many points, has the little peculiarity of liking to change his

lodgings once every three months on an average, which occasions some

bewilderment to his country friends, who have no sooner learnt the 19,

Belle Vue Road, Hampstead, than they have to take pains to forget that

address, and to remember the 27, Upper Brown Street, Camberwell;

and so on, till I would rather learn a page of _Walker's Pronouncing

Dictionary_, than try to remember the variety of directions which I have

had to put on my letters to Mr. B. during the last three years. Last

summer it pleased him to remove to a beautiful village not ten miles out

of London, where there is a railway station. Thither his friend sought

him. (I do not now speak of the following scent there had been through

three or four different lodgings, where Mr. B. had been residing, before

his country friend ascertained that he was now lodging at R----.) He

spent the morning in making inquiries as to Mr. B.'s whereabouts in

the village; but many gentlemen were lodging there for the summer, and

neither butcher nor baker could inform him where Mr. B. was staying; his

letters were unknown at the post-office, which was accounted for by the

circumstance of their always being directed to his office in town. At

last the country friend sauntered back to the railway-office, and while

he waited for the train he made inquiry, as a last resource, of the

book-keeper at the station. ""No, sir, I cannot tell you where Mr. B.

lodges--so many gentlemen go by the trains; but I have no doubt but

that the person standing by that pillar can inform you."" The individual

to whom he directed the inquirer's attention had the appearance of a

tradesman--respectable enough, yet with no pretensions to ""gentility,""

and had, apparently, no more urgent employment than lazily watching the

passengers who came dropping in to the station. However, when he was

spoken to, he answered civilly and promptly. ""Mr. B.? tall gentleman,

with light hair? Yes, sir, I know Mr. B. He lodges at No. 8, Morton

Villas--has done these three weeks or more; but you'll not find him

there, sir, now. He went to town by the eleven o'clock train, and does

not usually return until the half-past four train.""



The country friend had no time to lose in returning to the village, to

ascertain the truth of this statement. He thanked his informant, and

said he would call on Mr. B. at his office in town; but before he left

R----station, he asked the book-keeper who the person was to whom he had

referred him for information as to his friend's place of residence. ""One

of the Detective Police, sir,"" was the answer. I need hardly say that

Mr. B., not without a little surprise, confirmed the accuracy of the

policeman's report in every particular.



When I heard this anecdote of my cousin and his friend, I thought that

there could be no more romances written on the same kind of plot as

Caleb Williams; the principal interest of which, to the superficial

reader, consists in the alternation of hope and fear, that the hero may,

or may not, escape his pursuer. It is long since I have read the story,

and I forget the name of the offended and injured gentleman, whose

privacy Caleb has invaded; but I know that his pursuit of Caleb--his

detection of the various hiding-places of the latter--his following up

of slight clues--all, in fact, depended upon his own energy, sagacity,

and perseverance. The interest was caused by the struggle of man against

man; and the uncertainty as to which would ultimately be successful in

his object; the unrelenting pursuer, or the ingenious Caleb, who seeks

by every device to conceal himself. Now, in 1851, the offended master

would set the Detective Police to work; there would be no doubt as to

their success; the only question would be as to the time that would

elapse before the hiding-place could be detected, and that could not be

a question long. It is no longer a struggle between man and man, but

between a vast organized machinery, and a weak, solitary individual; we

have no hopes, no fears--only certainty. But if the materials of pursuit

and evasion, as long as the chase is confined to England, are taken away

from the store-house of the romancer, at any rate we can no more be

haunted by the idea of the possibility of mysterious disappearances; and

any one who has associated much with those who were alive at the end of

the last century, can testify that there was some reason for such fears.



When I was a child, I was sometimes permitted to accompany a relation

to drink tea with a very clever old lady, of one hundred and twenty--or,

so I thought then; I now think she, perhaps, was only about seventy.

She was lively, and intelligent, and had seen and known much that was

worth narrating. She was a cousin of the Sneyds, the family whence Mr.

Edgeworth took two of his wives; had known Major Andr; had mixed in the

Old Whig Society that the beautiful Duchess of Devonshire and ""Buff and

Blue Mrs. Crewe"" gathered round them; her father had been one of the

early patrons of the lovely Miss Linley. I name these facts to show that

she was too intelligent and cultivated by association, as well as by

natural powers, to lend an over-easy credence to the marvellous; and

yet I have heard her relate stories of disappearances which haunted

my imagination longer than any tale of wonder. One of her stories was

this:--Her father's estate lay in Shropshire, and his park-gates opened

right on to a scattered village of which he was landlord. The houses

formed a straggling irregular street--here a garden, next a gable-end of

a farm, there a row of cottages, and so on. Now, at the end house or

cottage lived a very respectable man and his wife. They were well known

in the village, and were esteemed for the patient attention which they

paid to the husband's father, a paralytic old man. In winter, his chair

was near the fire; in summer, they carried him out into the open space

in front of the house to bask in the sunshine, and to receive what

placid amusement he could from watching the little passings to and fro

of the villagers. He could not move from his bed to his chair without

help. One hot and sultry June day, all the village turned out to the

hay-fields. Only the very old and the very young remained.



The old father of whom I have spoken was carried out to bask in the

sunshine that afternoon as usual, and his son and daughter-in-law went

to the hay-making. But when they came home in the early evening, their

paralysed father had disappeared--was gone! and from that day forwards,

nothing more was ever heard of him. The old lady, who told this story,

said with the quietness that always marked the simplicity of her

narration, that every inquiry which her father could make was made, and

that it could never be accounted for. No one had observed any stranger

in the village; no small household robbery, to which the old man might

have been supposed an obstacle, had been committed in his son's dwelling

that afternoon. The son and daughter-in-law (noted too for their

attention to the helpless father) had been a-field among all the

neighbours the whole of the time. In short, it never was accounted for;

and left a painful impression on many minds.



I will answer for it, the Detective Police would have ascertained every

fact relating to it in a week.



This story from its mystery was painful, but had no consequences to make

it tragical. The next which I shall tell (and although traditionary,

these anecdotes of disappearances which I relate in this paper are

correctly repeated, and were believed by my informants to be strictly

true), had consequences, and melancholy ones too. The scene of it is in

a little country-town, surrounded by the estates of several gentlemen of

large property. About a hundred years ago there lived in this small town

an attorney, with his mother and sister. He was agent for one of the

squires near, and received rents for him on stated days, which of course

were well known. He went at these times to a small public-house, perhaps

five miles from ----, where the tenants met him, paid their rents, and

were entertained at dinner afterwards. One night he did not return from

this festivity. He never returned. The gentleman whose agent he was,

employed the Dogberrys of the time to find him, and the missing cash;

the mother, whose support and comfort he was, sought him with all the

perseverance of faithful love. But he never returned; and by-and-by the

rumour spread that he must have gone abroad with the money; his mother

heard the whispers all around her, and could not disprove it; and so her

heart broke, and she died. Years after, I think as many as fifty, the

well-to-do butcher and grazier of ---- died; but, before his death, he

confessed that he had waylaid Mr. ---- on the heath close to the town,

almost within call of his own house, intending only to rob him, but

meeting with more resistance than he anticipated, had been provoked to

stab him; and had buried him that very night deep under the loose sand

of the heath. There his skeleton was found; but too late for his poor

mother to know that his fame was cleared. His sister, too, was dead,

unmarried, for no one liked the possibilities which might arise from

being connected with the family. None cared if he was guilty or innocent

now.



If our Detective Police had only been in existence!



This last is hardly a story of unaccounted-for disappearance. It is only

unaccounted for in one generation. But disappearances never to be

accounted for on any supposition are not uncommon, among the traditions

of the last century. I have heard (and I think I have read it in one of

the earlier numbers of _Chambers's Journal_), of a marriage which took

place in Lincolnshire about the year 1750. It was not then _de rigueur_

that the happy couple should set out on a wedding journey; but instead,

they and their friends had a merry jovial dinner at the house of either

bride or groom; and in this instance the whole party adjourned to the

bridegroom's residence, and dispersed, some to ramble in the garden,

some to rest in the house until the dinner-hour. The bridegroom, it is

to be supposed, was with his bride, when he was suddenly summoned away

by a domestic, who said that a stranger wished to speak to him; and

henceforward he was never seen more. The same tradition hangs about

an old deserted Welsh Hall standing in a wood near Festiniog; there,

too, the bridegroom was sent for to give audience to a stranger on his

wedding-day, and disappeared from the face of the earth from that time;

but there, they tell in addition, that the bride lived long,--that she

passed her three-score years and ten, but that daily during all those

years, while there was light of sun or moon to lighten the earth, she

sat watching,--watching at one particular window which commanded a view

of the approach to the house. Her whole faculties, her whole mental

powers, became absorbed in that weary watching; long before she died,

she was childish, and only conscious of one wish--to sit in that long

high window, and watch the road, along which he might come. She was as

faithful as Evangeline, if pensive and inglorious.



That these two similar stories of disappearance on a wedding-day

""obtained,"" as the French say, shows us that anything which adds to

our facility of communication, and organization of means, adds to our

security of life. Only let a bridegroom try to disappear from an untamed

_Katherine_ of a bride, and he will soon be brought home, like a

recreant coward, overtaken by the electric telegraph, and clutched back

to his fate by a detective policeman.



Two more stories of disappearance, and I have done. I will give you the

last in date first, because it is the most melancholy; and we will wind

up cheerfully (after a fashion). Some time between 1820 and 1830, there

lived in North Shields a respectable old woman, and her son, who was

trying to struggle into sufficient knowledge of medicine, to go out as

ship-surgeon in a Baltic vessel, and perhaps in this manner to earn

money enough to spend a session in Edinburgh. He was furthered in all

his plans by the late benevolent Dr. G----, of that town. I believe the

usual premium was not required in his case; the young man did many

useful errands and offices which a finer young gentleman would have

considered beneath him; and he resided with his mother in one of the

alleys (or ""chares,"") which lead down from the main street of North

Shields to the river. Dr. G----had been with a patient all night, and

left her very early on a winter's morning to return home to bed; but

first he stepped down to his apprentice's home, and bade him get up, and

follow him to his own house, where some medicine was to be mixed, and

then taken to the lady. Accordingly the poor lad came, prepared the

dose, and set off with it some time between five and six on a winter's

morning. He was never seen again. Dr. G---- waited, thinking he was at

his mother's house; she waited, considering that he had gone to his

day's work. And meanwhile, as people remembered afterwards, the small

vessel bound to Edinburgh sailed out of port. The mother expected

him back her whole life long; but some years afterwards occurred the

discoveries of the Hare and Burke horrors, and people seemed to gain

a dark glimpse at his fate; but I never heard that it was fully

ascertained, or indeed more than surmised. I ought to add that all

who knew him spoke emphatically as to his steadiness of purpose, and

conduct, so as to render it improbable in the highest degree that he

had run off to sea, or suddenly changed his plan of life in any way.



My last story is one of a disappearance which was accounted for after

many years. There is a considerable street in Manchester leading from

the centre of the town to some of the suburbs. This street is called at

one part Garratt, and afterwards, where it emerges into gentility and,

comparatively, country, Brook Street. It derives its former name from an

old black-and-white hall of the time of Richard the Third, or thereabouts,

to judge from the style of building; they have closed in what is left

of the old hall now; but a few years since this old house was visible

from the main road; it stood low on some vacant ground, and appeared to

be half in ruins. I believe it was occupied by several poor families who

rented tenements in the tumble-down dwelling. But formerly it was Gerard

Hall, (what a difference between Gerard and Garratt!) and was surrounded

by a park with a clear brook running through it, with pleasant fish-ponds,

(the name of these was preserved until very lately, on a street near,)

orchards, dovecotes, and similar appurtenances to the manor-houses of

former days. I am almost sure that the family to whom it belonged were

Mosleys, probably a branch of the tree of the lord of the Manor of

Manchester. Any topographical work of the last century relating to their

district would give the name of the last proprietor of the old stock,

and it is to him that my story refers.



Many years ago there lived in Manchester two old maiden ladies, of high

respectability. All their lives had been spent in the town, and they

were fond of relating the changes which had taken place within their

recollection, which extended back to seventy or eighty years from the

present time. They knew much of its traditionary history from their

father, as well; who, with his father before him, had been respectable

attorneys in Manchester, during the greater part of the last century:

they were, also, agents for several of the county families, who, driven

from their old possessions by the enlargement of the town, found

some compensation in the increased value of any land which they might

choose to sell. Consequently the Messrs. S----, father and son, were

conveyancers in good repute, and acquainted with several secret pieces

of family history, one of which related to Garratt Hall.



The owner of this estate, some time in the first half of the last

century, married young; he and his wife had several children, and lived

together in a quiet state of happiness for many years. At last, business

of some kind took the husband up to London; a week's journey in those

days. He wrote and announced his arrival; I do not think he ever wrote

again. He seemed to be swallowed up in the abyss of the metropolis,

for no friend (and the lady had many and powerful friends) could ever

ascertain for her what had become of him; the prevalent idea was that

he had been attacked by some of the street-robbers who prowled about

in those days, that he had resisted, and had been murdered. His wife

gradually gave up all hopes of seeing him again, and devoted herself

to the care of her children; and so they went on, tranquilly enough,

until the heir came of age, when certain deeds were necessary before he

could legally take possession of the property. These deeds Mr. S----

(the family lawyer) stated had been given up by him into the missing

gentleman's keeping just before the last mysterious journey to London,

with which I think they were in some way concerned. It was possible that

they were still in existence; some one in London might have them in

possession, and be either conscious or unconscious of their importance.

At any rate, Mr. S----'s advice to his client was that he should put an

advertisement in the London papers, worded so skilfully that any one

who might hold the important documents should understand to what it

referred, and no one else. This was accordingly done; and although

repeated at intervals for some time, it met with no success. But at

last a mysterious answer was sent; to the effect that the deeds were in

existence, and should be given up; but only on certain conditions, and

to the heir himself. The young man, in consequence, went up to London,

and adjourned, according to directions, to an old house in Barbican,

where he was told by a man, apparently awaiting him, that he must submit

to be blindfolded, and must follow his guidance. He was taken through

several long passages before he left the house; at the termination of

one of these he was put into a sedan-chair, and carried about for an

hour or more; he always reported that there were many turnings, and that

he imagined he was set down finally not very far from his starting

point.



When his eyes were unbandaged, he was in a decent sitting-room, with

tokens of family occupation lying about. A middle-aged gentleman

entered, and told him that, until a certain time had elapsed (which

should be indicated to him in a particular way, but of which the length

was not then named), he must swear to secrecy as to the means by which

he obtained possession of the deeds. This oath was taken; and then the

gentleman, not without some emotion, acknowledged himself to be the

missing father of the heir. It seems that he had fallen in love with a

damsel, a friend of the person with whom he lodged. To this young woman

he had represented himself as unmarried; she listened willingly to his

wooing, and her father, who was a shopkeeper in the City, was not averse

to the match, as the Lancashire squire had a goodly presence, and many

similar qualities, which the shopkeeper thought might be acceptable to

his customers. The bargain was struck; the descendant of a knightly race

married the only daughter of the City shopkeeper, and became a junior

partner in the business. He told his son that he had never repented

the step he had taken; that his lowly-born wife was sweet, docile, and

affectionate; that his family by her was large; and that he and they

were thriving and happy. He inquired after his first (or rather, I

should say, his true) wife with friendly affection; approved of what she

had done with regard to his estate, and the education of his children;

but said that he considered he was dead to her, as she was to him. When

he really died he promised that a particular message, the nature of

which he specified, should be sent to his son at Garrett; until then

they would not hear more of each other; for it was of no use attempting

to trace him under his incognito, even if the oath did not render such

an attempt forbidden. I dare say the youth had no great desire to trace

out the father, who had been one in name only. He returned to Lancashire;

took possession of the property at Manchester; and many years elapsed

before he received the mysterious intimation of his father's real death.

After that, he named the particulars connected with the recovery of the

title-deeds to Mr. S., and one or two intimate friends. When the family

became extinct, or removed from Garratt, it became no longer any very

closely kept secret, and I was told the tale of the disappearance by

Miss S., the aged daughter of the family agent.



Once more, let me say I am thankful I live in the days of the Detective

Police; if I am murdered, or commit bigamy, at any rate my friends will

have the comfort of knowing all about it.



A correspondent has favoured us with the sequel of the disappearance

of the pupil of Dr. G., who vanished from North Shields, in charge

of certain potions he was entrusted with, very early one morning, to

convey to a patient:--""Dr. G.'s son married my sister, and the young

man who disappeared was a pupil in the house. When he went out with the

medicine, he was hardly dressed, having merely thrown on some clothes;

and he went in slippers--which incidents induced the belief that he was

made away with. After some months his family put on mourning; and the

G.'s (_very_ timid people) were so sure that he was murdered, that

they wrote verses to his memory, and became sadly worn by terror. But,

after a long time (I fancy, but am not sure, about a year and a half),

came a letter from the young man, who was doing well in America. His

explanation was, that a vessel was lying at the wharf about to sail in

the morning, and the youth, who had long meditated evasion, thought it a

good opportunity, and stepped on board, after leaving the medicine at

the proper door. I spent some weeks at Dr. G.'s after the occurrence;

and very doleful we used to be about it. But the next time I went they

were, naturally, very angry with the inconsiderate young man.""

DONOVAN PASHA AND SOME PEOPLE OF EGYPT



By Gilbert Parker



Volume 3.







THE MAN AT THE WHEEL

A TYRANT AND A LADY









THE MAN AT THE WHEEL



Wyndham Bimbashi's career in Egypt had been a series of mistakes.  In the

first place he was opinionated, in the second place he never seemed to

have any luck; and, worst of all, he had a little habit of doing grave

things on his own lightsome responsibility.  This last quality was

natural to him, but he added to it a supreme contempt for the native

mind and an unhealthy scorn of the native official.  He had not that

rare quality, constantly found among his fellow-countrymen, of working

the native up through his own medium, as it were, through his own customs

and predispositions, to the soundness of Western methods of government.

Therefore, in due time he made some dangerous mistakes.  By virtue of

certain high-handed actions he was the cause of several riots in native

villages, and he had himself been attacked at more than one village as he

rode between the fields of sugar-cane.  On these occasions he had behaved

very well--certainly no one could possibly doubt his bravery; but that

was a small offset to the fact that his want of tact and his overbearing

manner had been the means of turning a certain tribe of Arabs loose upon

the country, raiding and killing.



But he could not, or would not, see his own vain stupidity.  The climax

came in a foolish sortie against the Arab tribe he had offended.  In that

unauthorised melee, in covert disobedience to a general order not to

attack, unless at advantage--for the Gippies under him were raw levies--

his troop was diminished by half; and, cut off from the Nile by a flank

movement of the Arabs, he was obliged to retreat and take refuge in the

well-fortified and walled house which had previously been a Coptic

monastery.



Here, at last, the truth came home to Wyndham bimbashi.  He realised that

though in his six years' residence in the land he had acquired a command

of Arabic equal to that of others who had been in the country twice that

time, he had acquired little else.  He awoke to the fact that in his

cock-sure schemes for the civil and military life of Egypt there was

not one element of sound sense; that he had been all along an egregious

failure.  It did not come home to him with clear, accurate conviction--

his brain was not a first-rate medium for illumination; but the facts

struck him now with a blind sort of force; and he accepted the blank

sensation of failure.  Also, he read in the faces of those round him an

alien spirit, a chasm of black misunderstanding which his knowledge of

Arabic could never bridge over.



Here he was, shut up with Gippies who had no real faith in him, in the

house of a Sheikh whose servants would cut his throat on no provocation

at all; and not an eighth of a mile away was a horde of Arabs--a circle

of death through which it was impossible to break with the men in his

command.  They must all die here, if they were not relieved.



The nearest garrison was at Kerbat, sixty miles away, where five hundred

men were stationed.  Now that his cup of mistakes was full, Wyndham

bimbashi would willingly have made the attempt to carry word to the

garrison there.  But he had no right to leave his post.  He called for

a volunteer.  No man responded.  Panic was upon the Gippies.  Though

Wyndham's heart sickened within him, his lips did not frame a word of

reproach; but a blush of shame came into his face, and crept up to his

eyes, dimming them.  For there flashed through his mind what men at home

would think of him when this thing, such an end to his whole career,

was known.  As he stood still, upright and confounded, some one touched

his arm.



It was Hassan, his Soudanese servant.  Hassan was the one person in Egypt

who thoroughly believed in him.  Wyndham was as a god to Hassan, though

this same god had given him a taste of a belt more than once.  Hassan

had not resented the belt, though once, in a moment of affectionate

confidence, he had said to Wyndham that when his master got old and died

he would be the servant of an American or a missionary, ""which no whack

Mahommed.""



It was Hassan who now volunteered to carry word to the garrison at

Kerbat.



""If I no carry, you whack me with belt, Saadat,"" said Hassan, whose logic

and reason were like his master's, neither better nor worse.



""If you do, you shall have fifty pounds--and the missionary,"" answered

Wyndham, his eyes still cloudy and his voice thick; for it touched him in

a tender nerve that this one Soudanese boy should believe in him and do

for him what he would give much to do for the men under him.  For his

own life he did not care--his confusion and shame were so great.



He watched Hassan steal out into the white brilliance of the night.



""Mind you keep a whole skin, Hassan,"" he said, as the slim lad with the

white teeth, oily hair, and legs like ivory, stole along the wall, to

drop presently on his belly and make for some palm-trees a hundred yards

away.



The minutes went by in silence; an hour went by; the whole night went by;

Hassan had got beyond the circle of trenchant steel.



They must now abide Hassan's fate; but another peril was upon them.

There was not a goolah of water within the walls!



It was the time of low Nile when all the land is baked like a crust of

bread, when the creaking of the shadoofs and the singing croak of the

sakkia are heard the night long like untiring crickets with throats of

frogs.  It was the time succeeding the khamsin, when the skin dries like

slaked lime and the face is for ever powdered with dust; and the

fellaheen, in the slavery of superstition, strain their eyes day and

night for the Sacred Drop, which tells that the flood is flowing fast

from the hills of Abyssinia.



It was like the Egyptian that nothing should be said to Wyndham about the

dearth of water until it was all gone.  The house of the Sheikh, and its

garden, where were a pool and a fountain, were supplied from the great

Persian wheel at the waterside.  On this particular sakkia had been wont

to sit all day a patient fellah, driving the blindfolded buffaloes in

their turn.  It was like the patient fellah, when the Arabs, in pursuit

of Wyndham and his Gippies, suddenly cut in between him and the house, to

deliver himself over to the conqueror, with his hand upon his head in

sign of obedience.



It was also like the gentle Egyptian that he eagerly showed the besiegers

how the water could be cut off from the house by dropping one of the

sluice-gates; while, opening another, all the land around the Arab

encampments might be well watered, the pools well filled, and the grass

kept green for horses and camels.  This was the reason that Wyndham

bimbashi and his Gippies, and the Sheikh and his household, faced the

fact, the morning after Hassan left, that there was scarce a goolah of

water for a hundred burning throats.  Wyndham understood now why the

Arabs sat down and waited, that torture might be added to the oncoming

death of the Englishman, his natives, and the ""friendlies.""



All that day terror and ghastly hate hung like a miasma over the besieged

house and garden.  Fifty eyes hungered for the blood of Wyndham bimbashi;

not because he was Wyndham bimbashi, but because the heathen in these men

cried out for sacrifice; and what so agreeable a sacrifice as the

Englishman who had led them into this disaster and would die so well

--had they ever seen an Englishman who did not die well?



Wyndham was quiet and watchful, and he cudgelled his bullet-head, and

looked down his long nose in meditation all the day, while his tongue

became dry and thick, and his throat seemed to crack like roasting

leather.  At length he worked the problem out.  Then he took action.



He summoned his troop before him, and said briefly: ""Men, we must have

water.  The question is, who is going to steal out to the sakkia to-

night, to shut the one sluice and open the other?""



No one replied.  No one understood quite what Wyndham meant.  Shutting

one sluice and opening the other did not seem to meet the situation.

There was the danger of getting to the sakkia, but there was also an

after.  Would it be possible to shut one sluice and open the other

without the man at the wheel knowing?  Suppose you killed the man at the

wheel--what then?



The Gippies and the friendlies scowled, but did not speak.  The bimbashi

was responsible for all; he was an Englishman, let him get water for

them, or die like the rest of them--perhaps before them!



Wyndham could not travel the sinuosities of their minds, and it would not

have affected his purpose if he could have done so.  When no man replied,

he simply said:



""All right, men.  You shall have water before morning.  Try and hold out

till then.""  He dismissed them.  For a long time he walked up and down

the garden of straggling limes, apparently listless, and smoking hard.

He reckoned carefully how long it would take Hassan to get to Kerbat, and

for relief to come.  He was fond of his pipe, and he smoked now as if it

were the thing he most enjoyed in the world.  He held the bowl in the

hollow of his hand almost tenderly.  He seemed unconscious of the

scowling looks around him.  At last he sat down on the ledge of the rude

fountain, with his face towards the Gippies and the Arabs squatted on the

ground, some playing mankalah, others sucking dry lime leaves, many

smoking apathetically.



One man with the flicker of insanity in his eyes suddenly ran forward and

threw himself on the ground before Wyndham.



""In the name of God the Compassionate, the Merciful--water!"" he cried.

""Water--I am dying, effendi whom God preserve!""



""Nile water is sweet; you shall drink it before morning, Mahommed,""

answered Wyndham quietly.  ""God will preserve your life till the Nile

water cools your throat.""



""Before dawn, O effendi?"" gasped the Arab.  ""Before dawn, by the mercy

of God,"" answered Wyndham; and for the first time in his life he had a

burst of imagination.  The Orient had touched him at last.



""Is not the song of the sakkia in thine ear, Mahommed?"" he said



    ""Turn, O Sakkia, turn to the right, and turn to the left.

     The Nile floweth by night and the balasses are filled at dawn--

     The maid of the village shall bear to thy bed the dewy grey

          goolah at dawn

                    Turn, O Sakkia!""



Wyndham was learning at last the way to the native mind.



The man rose from his knees.  A vision of his home in the mirkaz of

Minieh passed before him.  He stretched out his hands, and sang in the

vibrating monotone of his people:



    ""Turn, O Sakkia, turn to the right, and turn to the left:

     Who will take care of me, if my father dies?

     Who will give me water to drink, and the cucumber vine at my door--

     Turn, O Sakkia!""



Then he crept back again to the wall of the house, where he huddled

between a Berberine playing a darabukkeh and a man of the Fayoum who

chanted the fatihah from the Koran.



Wyndham looked at them all and pondered.  ""If the devils out there would

only attack us,"" he said between his teeth, ""or if we could only attack

them!"" he added, and he nervously hastened his footsteps; for to him

this inaction was terrible.  ""They'd forget their thirst if they were

fighting,"" he muttered, and then he frowned; for the painful neighing of

the horses behind the house came to his ear.  In desperation he

went inside and climbed to the roof, where he could see the circle of the

enemy.



It was no use.  They were five to one, and his Gippies were demoralised.

It would be a fine bit of pluck to try and cut his way through the Arabs

to the Nile--but how many would reach it?



No, he had made his full measure of mistakes, he would not add to the

list.  If Hassan got through to Kerbat his Gippies here would no doubt be

relieved, and there would be no more blood on his head.  Relieved?  And

when they were relieved, what of himself, Wyndham bimbashi?  He knew what

men would say in Cairo, what men would say at the War Office in London

town, at ""The Rag""--everywhere!  He could not look his future in the

face.  He felt that every man in Egypt, save himself, had known all along

that he was a complete failure.



It did not matter while he himself was not conscious of it; but now that

the armour-plate of conceit protecting his honest mind had been torn away

on the reefs of foolish deeds, it mattered everything.  For when his

conceit was peeled away, there was left a crimson cuticle of the Wyndham

pride.  Certainly he could not attack the Arabs--he had had his eternal

fill of sorties.



Also he could not wait for the relief party, for his Gippies and the

friendlies were famishing, dying of thirst.  He prayed for night.  How

slowly the minutes, the hours passed; and how bright was the moon when it

rose! brighter even than it was when Hassan crept out to steal through

the Arab lines.



                    .....................



At midnight, Wyndham stole softly out of a gate in the garden wall, and,

like Hassan, dropping to the ground, crept towards a patch of maize lying

between the house and the river.  He was dressed like a fellah, with the

long blue yelek, and a poor wool fez, and round the fez was a white

cloth, as it were to protect his mouth from the night air, after the

manner of the peasant.



The fires of the enemy were dying down, and only here and there Arabs

gossiped or drank coffee by the embers.  At last Wyndham was able to drop

into the narrow channel, now dry, through which, when the sluice was open

and the sakkia turned, the water flowed to the house.  All went well till

he was within a hundred yards of the wheel, though now and again he could

hear sentries snoring or talking just above him.  Suddenly he heard

breathing an arm's length before him, then a figure raised itself and a

head turned towards him.  The Arab had been asleep, but his hand ran to

his knife by instinct--too late, for Wyndham's fingers were at his

throat, and he had neither time nor chance to cry Allah!  before the

breath left him.



Wyndham crept on.  The sound of the sakkia was in his ears--the long,

creaking, crying song, filling the night.  And now there arose the Song

of the Sakkia from the man at the wheel:



    ""Turn, O Sakkia, turn to the right, and turn to the left;

     The heron feeds by the water side--shall I starve in my onion-field!

     Shall the Lord of the World withhold his tears that water the land--

     Turn, O Sakkia!""



.  .  .  The hard white stars, the cold blue sky, the far-off Libyan

hills in a gold and opal glow, the smell of the desert, the deep swish of

the Nile, the Song of the Sakkia.  .  .  .



Wyndham's heart beat faster, his blood flowed quicker, he strangled a

sigh in his breast.  Here, with death on every hand, with immediate and

fearful peril before him, out of the smell of the desert and the ghostly

glow of the Libyan hills there came a memory--the memory of a mistake he

had made years before with a woman.  She had never forgiven him for the

mistake--he knew it at last.  He knew that no woman could ever forgive

the blunder he had made--not a blunder of love but a blunder of self-will

and an unmanly, unmannerly conceit.  It had nearly wrecked her life: and

he only realised it now, in the moment of clear-seeing which comes to

every being once in a lifetime.  Well, it was something to have seen the

mistake at last.



He had come to the sluice-gate.  It was impossible to open it without the

fellah on the water-wheel seeing him.



There was another way.  He crept close and closer to the wheel.  The

breath of the blindfolded buffalo was in his face, he drew himself up

lightly and quickly beside the buffalo--he was making no blunder now.



Suddenly he leapt from behind the buffalo upon the fellah and smothered

his mouth in the white cloth he had brought.  There was a moment's

struggle, then, as the wheel went slower and slower, and the patient

buffalo stopped, Wyndham dropped the gagged, but living, fellah into a

trench by the sakkia and, calling to the buffalo, slid over swiftly,

opened the sluice-gate of the channel which fed the house, and closed

that leading to the Arab encampment.



Then he sat down where the fellah had sat, and the sakkia droned its

mystic music over the river, the desert, and the plain.  But the buffalo

moved slowly-the fellah's song had been a spur to its travel, as the

camel-driver's song is to the caravan in the waste of sands.  Wyndham

hesitated an instant, then, as the first trickle of water entered the

garden of the house where his Gippies and the friendlies were, his voice

rose in the Song of the Sakkia:



    ""Turn, O Sakkia, turn to the right, and turn to the left:

     Who will take care of me, if my father dies?

     Who will give me water to drink, and the cucumber vine at my door

     Turn, O Sakkia!""



If he had but one hour longer there would be enough water for men and

horses for days, twenty jars of water pouring all the time!



Now and again a figure came towards the wheel, but not close enough to

see that the one sluice-gate had been shut and the other opened.  A half-

hour passed, an hour, and then the end came.



The gagged fellah had managed to free his mouth, and though his feet were

bound also and he could not loose them, he gave a loud call for help.

From dying fires here and there Arab sentries sprang to their feet with

rifles and lances.



Wyndham's work was done.  He leapt from the sakkia, and ran towards the

house.  Shot after shot was fired at him, lances were thrown, and once an

Arab barred his way suddenly.  He pistoled him and ran on.  A lance

caught him in the left arm.  He tore it out and pushed forward.  Stooping

once, he caught up a sword from the ground.  When he was within fifty

yards of the house, four Arabs intercepted him.  He slashed through, then

turned with his pistol and fired as he ran quickly towards the now open

gate.  He was within ten yards of it, and had fired his last shot, when a

bullet crashed through his jaw.



A dozen Gippies ran out, dragged him in, and closed the gate.



The last thing Wyndham did before he died in the grey of dawn--and this

is told of him by the Gippies themselves-was to cough up the bullet from

his throat, and spit it out upon the ground.  The Gippies thought it a

miraculous feat, and that he had done it in scorn of the Arab foe.



Before another sunrise and sunset had come, Wyndham bimbashi's men were

relieved by the garrison of Kerbat, after a hard fight.



There are Englishmen in Egypt who still speak slightingly of Wyndham

bimbashi, but the British officer who buried him hushed a gossiping

dinner-party a few months ago in Cairo by saying:



         ""Lightly they'll talk of the spirit that's gone,

            And o'er his cold ashes upbraid him;

          But little he'll reek, if they let him sleep on

            In the grave where his Gippies have laid him.""



And he did not apologise for paraphrasing the famous ballad.  He has

shamed Egypt at last into admiration for Wyndham bimbashi: to the deep

satisfaction of Hassan, the Soudanese boy, who received his fifty pounds,

and to this day wears the belt which once kept him in the narrow path of

duty.













A TYRANT AND A LADY



When Donovan Pasha discovered the facts for the first time, he found more

difficulty in keeping the thing to himself than he had ever found with

any other matter in Egypt.  He had unearthed one of those paradoxes which

make for laughter--and for tears.  It gave him both; he laughed till he

cried.  Then he went to the Khedivial Club and ordered himself four

courses, a pint of champagne and a glass of '48 port, his usual dinner

being one course, double portion, and a pint of claret.  As he sat eating

he kept reading a letter over and over, and each time he read he grinned

--he did not smile like a well-behaved man of the world, he did not

giggle like a well-veneered Egyptian back from Paris, he chuckled

like a cabman responding to a liberal fare and a good joke.  A more

unconventional little man never lived.  Simplicity was his very life,

and yet he had a gift for following the sinuosities of the Oriental mind;

he had a quality almost clairvoyant, which came, perhaps, from his Irish

forebears.  The cross-strain of English blood had done him good too; it

made him punctilious and kept his impulses within secure bounds.  It also

made him very polite when he was angry, and very angry when any one tried

to impose upon him, or flatter him.



The letter he read so often was from Kingsley Bey, the Englishman, who,

coming to Egypt penniless, and leaving estates behind him encumbered

beyond release, as it would seem, had made a fortune and a name in a

curious way.  For years he had done no good for himself, trying his hand

at many things--sugar, salt, cotton, cattle, but always just failing to

succeed, though he came out of his enterprises owing no one.  Yet he had

held to his belief that he would make a fortune, and he allowed his

estates to become still more encumbered, against the advice of his

solicitors, who grew more irritable as interest increased and rents

further declined.  The only European in Egypt who shared his own belief

in himself was Dicky Donovan.  Something in the unfailing good-humour,

the buoyant energy, the wide imagination of the man seized Dicky,

warranted the conviction that he would yet make a success.  There were

reasons why sugar, salt, cotton, cattle and other things had not done

well.  Taxes, the corvee, undue influence in favour of pashas who could

put his water on their land without compensation, or unearthed old unpaid

mortgages on his land, or absorbed his special salt concession in the

Government monopoly, or suddenly put a tax on all horses and cattle not

of native breed; all these and various other imposts, exactions, or

interferences engineered by the wily Mamour, the agent of the mouffetish,

or the intriguing Pasha, killed his efforts, in spite of labours

unbelievable.  The venture before the last had been sugar, and when he

arrived in Cairo, having seen his fields and factories absorbed in the

Khedive's domains, he had but one ten pounds to his name.



He went to Dicky Donovan and asked the loan of a thousand pounds.  It

took Dicky's breath away.  His own banking account seldom saw a thousand

--deposit.  Dicky told Kingsley he hadn't got it.  Kingsley asked him to

get it--he had credit, could borrow it from the bank, from the Khedive

himself!  The proposal was audacious--Kingsley could offer no security

worth having.  His enthusiasm and courage were so infectious, however,

though his ventures had been so fruitless, that Dicky laughed in his

face.  Kingsley's manner then suddenly changed, and he assured Dicky

that he would receive five thousand pounds for the thousand within a

year.  Now, Dicky knew that Kingsley never made a promise to any one that

he did not fulfil.  He gave Kingsley the thousand pounds.  He did more.

He went to the Khedive with Kingsley's whole case.  He spoke as he had

seldom spoken, and he secured a bond from Ismail, which might not be

broken.  He also secured three thousand pounds of the Khedive's

borrowings from Europe, on Kingsley's promise that it should be returned

five-fold.



That was how Kingsley got started in the world again, how he went mining

in the desert afar, where pashas and mamours could not worry him.  The

secret of his success was purely Oriental.  He became a slave-owner.  He

built up a city of the desert round him.  He was its ruler.  Slavery gave

him steady untaxed labour.  A rifle-magazine gave him security against

marauding tribes, his caravans were never over powered; his blacks were

his own.  He had a way with them; they thought him the greatest man in

the world.  Now, at last, he was rich enough.  His mines were worked out,

too, and the market was not so good; he had supplied it too well.

Dicky's thousand had brought him five thousand, and Ismail's three

thousand had become fifteen thousand, and another twenty thousand

besides.  For once the Khedive had found a kind of taxation, of which he

got the whole proceeds, not divided among many as heretofore.  He got it

all.  He made Kingsley a Bey, and gave him immunity from all other

imposts or taxation.  Nothing but an Egyptian army could have removed him

from his desert-city.



Now, he was coming back--to-night at ten o'clock he would appear at the

Khedivial Club, the first time in seven years.  But this was not all.  He

was coming back to be married as soon as might be.



This was the thing which convulsed Dicky.



Upon the Nile at Assiout lived a young English lady whose life was

devoted to agitation against slavery in Egypt.  Perhaps the Civil War in

America, not so many years before, had fired her spirit; perhaps it was

pious enthusiasm; perhaps it was some altruistic sentiment in her which

must find expression; perhaps, as people said, she had had a love affair

in England which had turned out badly.  At any rate she had come over to

Egypt with an elderly companion, and, after a short stay at the

Consulate, had begun the career of the evangel.  She had now and then

created international difficulty, and Ismail, tolerant enough, had been

tempted to compel her to leave the country, but, with a zeal which took

on an aspect of self-opinionated audacity, she had kept on.  Perhaps her

beauty helped her on her course--perhaps the fact that her superb egotism

kept her from being timorous, made her career possible.  In any case,

there she was at Assiout, and there she had been for years, and no

accident had come to her; and, during the three months she was at

Cairo every year, pleading against slavery and the corvee, she increased

steadily the respect in which she was held; but she was considered mad as

Gordon.  So delighted had Ismail been by a quiet, personal attack she

made upon him, that without malice, and with an obtuse and impulsive

kindness, he sent her the next morning a young Circassian slave, as a

mark of his esteem, begging her through the swelling rhetoric of his

messenger to keep the girl, and more than hinting at her value.  It

stupefied her, and the laughter of Cairo added to her momentary

embarrassment; but she kept the girl, and prepared to send her back

to her people.



The girl said she had no people, and would not go; she would stay with

""My Lady""--she would stay for ever with ""My Lady.""  It was confusing, but

the girl stayed, worshipping the ground ""My Lady"" walked on.  In vain My

Lady educated her.  Out of hearing, she proudly told whoever would listen

that she was ""My Lady's slave.""  It was an Egyptian paradox; it was in

line with everything else in the country, part of the moral opera boufe.



In due course, the lady came to hear of the English slave-owner, who

ruled the desert-city and was making a great fortune out of the labours

of his slaves.  The desert Arabs who came down the long caravan road,

white with bleached bones, to Assiout, told her he had a thousand slaves.

Against this Englishman her anger, was great.  She unceasingly condemned

him, and whenever she met Dicky Donovan she delivered her attack with

delicate violence.  Did Dicky know him?  Why did not he, in favour with

Ismail, and with great influence, stop this dreadful and humiliating

business?  It was a disgrace to the English name.  How could we preach

freedom and a higher civilisation to the Egyptians while an Englishman

enriched himself and ruled a province by slavery?  Dicky's invariable

reply was that we couldn't, and that things weren't moving very much

towards a higher civilisation in Egypt.  But he asked her if she ever

heard of a slave running away from Kingsley Bey, or had she ever heard

of a case of cruelty on his part?  Her reply was that he had given slaves

the kourbash, and had even shot them.  Dicky thereupon suggested that

Kingsley Bey was a government, and that the kourbash was not yet

abolished in the English navy, for instance; also that men had to be shot

sometimes.



At last she had made a direct appeal to Kingsley Bey.  She sent an

embassy to him--Dicky prevented her from going herself; he said he would

have her deported straightway, if she attempted it.  She was not in such

deadly earnest that she did not know he would keep his word, and that the

Consulate could not help her would have no time to do so.  So, she

confined herself to an elaborate letter, written in admirable English and

inspired by most noble sentiments.  The beauty that was in her face was

in her letter in even a greater degree.  It was very adroit, too, very

ably argued, and the moral appeal was delicate and touching, put with an

eloquence at once direct and arresting.  The invocation with which the

letter ended was, as Kingsley Bey afterwards put it, ""a pitch of poetry

and humanity never reached except by a Wagner opera.""



Kingsley Bey's response to the appeal was a letter to the lady, brought

by a sarraf, a mamour and six slaves, beautifully mounted and armed,

saying that he had been deeply moved by her appeal, and as a proof of the

effect of her letter, she might free the six slaves of his embassy.  This

she straightway did joyfully, and when they said they wished to go to

Cairo, she saw them and their horses off on the boat with gladness, and

she shook them each by the hand and prayed Heaven in their language to

give them long plumes of life and happiness.  Arrived at Cairo these

freemen of Assiout did as they had been ordered by Kingsley--found

Donovan Pasha, delivered a certain letter to him, and then proceeded,

also as they had been ordered, to a certain place in the city, even to

Ismail's stables, to await their master's coming.



This letter was now in Dicky's hand, and his mirth was caused by the

statement that Kingsley Bey had declared that he was coming to marry My

Lady--she really was ""My Lady,"" the Lady May Harley; that he was coming

by a different route from ""his niggers,"" and would be there the same day.

Dicky would find him at ten o'clock at the Khedivial Club.



My Lady hated slavery--and unconsciously she kept a slave; she regarded

Kingsley Bey as an enemy to civilisation and to Egypt, she detested him

as strongly as an idealistic nature could and should--and he had set out

to marry her, the woman who had bitterly arraigned him at the bar of her

judgment.  All this play was in Dicky's hands for himself to enjoy, in a

perfect dress rehearsal ere ever one of the Cairene public or the English

world could pay for admission and take their seats.  Dicky had in more

senses than one got his money's worth out of Kingsley Bey.  He wished he

might let the Khedive into the secret at once, for he had an opinion of

Ismail's sense of humour; had he not said that very day in the presence

of the French Consul, ""Shut the window, quick!  If the consul sneezes,

France will demand compensation!""  But Dicky was satisfied that things

should be as they were.  He looked at the clock--it was five minutes to

ten.  He rose from the table, and went to the smoking-room.  In vain it

was sought to draw him into the friendly circles of gossiping idlers and

officials.  He took a chair at the very end of the room and opposite the

door, and waited, watching.



Precisely at ten the door opened and a tall, thin, loose-knit figure

entered.  He glanced quickly round, saw Dicky, and swung down the room,

nodding to men who sprang to their feet to greet him.  Some of the

Egyptians looked darkly at him, but he smiled all round, caught at one or

two hands thrust out to him, said: ""Business--business first!"" in a deep

bass voice, and, hastening on, seized both of Dicky's hands in his, then

his shoulders, and almost roared: ""Well, what do you think of it?  Isn't

it all right?  Am I, or am I not, Dicky Pasha?""



""You very much are,"" answered Dicky, thrust a cigar at him, and set him

down in the deepest chair he could find.  He sprawled wide, and lighted

his cigar, then lay back and looked down his long nose at his friend.



""I mean it, too,"" he said after a minute, and reached for a glass of

water the waiter brought.  ""No, thanks, no whiskey--never touch it--good

example to the slaves!""  He laughed long and low, and looked at Dicky out

of the corner of his eye.  ""Good-looking lot I sent you, eh?""



""Oosters, every one of 'em.  Butter wouldn't melt in their mouths.  I

learnt their grin, it suits my style of beauty.""  Dicky fitted the action

to the word.  ""You'll start with me in the morning to Assiout?""



""I can start, but life and time are short.""



""You think I can't and won't marry her?""



""This isn't the day of Lochinvar.""



""This is the day of Kingsley Bey, Dicky Pasha.""



Dicky frowned.  He had a rare and fine sense where women were concerned,

were they absent or present.  ""How very artless--and in so short a time,

too!"" he said tartly.



Kingsley laughed quietly.  ""Art is long, but tempers are short!"" he

retorted.



Dicky liked a Roland for his Oliver.  ""It's good to see you back again,""

he said, changing the subject.



""How long do you mean to stay?""



""Here?"" Dicky nodded.  ""Till I'm married.""



Dicky became very quiet, a little formal, and his voice took on a curious

smoothness, through which sharp suggestion pierced.



""So long?--Enter our Kingsley Bey into the underground Levantine world.""



This was biting enough.  To be swallowed up by Cairo life and all that it

involves, was no fate to suggest to an Englishman, whose opinion of the

Levantine needs no defining.  ""Try again, Dicky,"" said Kingsley, refusing

to be drawn.  ""This is not one huge joke, or one vast impertinence, so

far as the lady is concerned.  I've come back-b-a-c-k"" (he spelled the

word out), ""with all that it involves.  I've come back, Dicky.""



He quieted all at once, and leaned over towards his friend.  ""You know

the fight I've had.  You know the life I've lived in Egypt.  You know

what I left behind me in England--nearly all.  You've seen the white man

work.  You've seen the black ooster save him.  You've seen the ten-times-

a-failure pull out.  Have I played the game?  Have I acted squarely?

Have I given kindness for kindness, blow for blow?  Have I treated my

slaves like human beings?  Have I--have I won my way back to life--life?""

He spread out a hand with a little grasping motion.  ""Have I saved the

old stand off there in Cumberland by the sea, where you can see the snow

on Skaw Fell?  Have I?  Do you wonder that I laugh?  Ye gods and little

fishes!  I've had to wear a long face years enough--seven hard years,

seven fearful years, when I might be murdered by a slave, and I and my

slaves might be murdered by some stray brigade, under some general of

Ismail's, working without orders, without orders, of course--oh, very

much of course!  Why shouldn't I play the boy to-day, little Dicky

Donovan?  I am a Mahommedan come Christian again.  I am a navvy again

come gentleman.  I am an Arab come Englishman once more.



""I am an outcast come home.  I am a dead man come to life.""



Dicky leaned over and laid a hand on his knee.  ""You are a credit to

Cumberland,"" he said.  ""No other man could have done it.  I won't ask any

more questions.  Anything you want of me, I am with you, to do, or say,

or be.""



""Good.  I want you to go to Assiout to-morrow.""



""Will you see Ismail first?  It might be safer--good policy.""



""I will see My Lady first.  .  .  .  Trust me.  I know what I'm doing.

You will laugh as I do.""  Laughter broke from his lips.  It was as though

his heart was ten years old.  Dicky's eyes moistened.  He had never seen

anything like it--such happiness, such boyish confidence.  And what had

not this man experienced!  How had he drunk misfortune to the dregs!

What unbelievable optimism had been his!  How had he been at once hard

and kind, tyrannical and human, defiant and peaceful, daring yet

submissive, fierce yet just!  And now, here, with so much done, with a

great fortune and great power, a very boy, he was planning to win the

heart of, and marry, his avowed foe, the woman who had condemned him

without stint.









II



On her wide veranda, a stone's-throw from the banks of the Nile, My Lady

sat pen in hand and paper-pad upon her knee.  She had written steadily

for an hour, and now she raised her head to look out on the swift-

flowing, muddy water, where broad khiassas floated down the stream, laden

with bersim; where feluccas covered the river, bearing natives and

donkeys; where faithful Moslems performed their ablutions, and other

faithful Moslems, their sandals laid aside, said their prayers with their

faces towards Mecca, oblivious of all around; where blue-robed women

filled their goolahs with water, and bore them away, steady and stately;

where a gang of conscripts, chained ankle to ankle, followed by a crowd

of weeping and wailing women, were being driven to the anchorage of the

stern-wheeled transport-steamer.  All these sights she had seen how many

hundred times!  To her it was all slavery.  The laden khiassas

represented the fruits of enforced labour; the ablutions and prayers were

but signs of submission to the tyranny of a religion designed for the

benefit of the few at the expense of the many, a creed and code of gross

selfishness--were not women only admitted to Heaven by the intercession

of their husbands and after unceasing prayer?  Whether beasts of burden,

the girl with the goolah, women in the harem, or servants of pleasure,

they were all in the bonds of slavery, and the land was in moral

darkness.  So it seemed to her.



How many times had she written these things in different forms and to

different people--so often, too often, to the British Consul at Cairo,

whose patience waned.  At first, the seizure of conscripts, with all that

it involved, had excited her greatly.  It had required all her common-

sense to prevent her, then and there, protesting, pleading, with the

kavass, who did the duty of Ismail's Sirdar.  She had confined herself,

however, to asking for permission to give the men cigarettes and

slippers, dates and bread, and bags of lentils for soup.  Even this was

not unaccompanied by danger, for the Mahommedan mind could not at first

tolerate the idea of a lady going unveiled; only fellah women, domestic

cattle, bared their faces to the world.  The conscripts, too, going to

their death--for how few of them ever returned?--leaving behind all hope,

all freedom, passing to starvation and cruelty, at last to be cut down by

the Arab, or left dying of illness in the desert, they took her gifts

with sullen faces.  Her beautiful freedom was in such contrast to their

torture, slavery of a direful kind.  But as again and again the kavasses

came and opened midnight doors and snatched away the young men, her

influence had grown so fast that her presence brought comfort, and she

helped to assuage the grief of the wailing women.  She even urged upon

them that philosophy of their own, which said ""Malaish"" to all things--

the ""It is no matter,"" of the fated Hamlet.  In time she began to be

grateful that an apathetic resignation, akin to the quiet of despair,

was the possession of their race.  She was far from aware that something

in their life, of their philosophy, was affecting her understanding.

She had a strong brain and a stronger will, but she had a capacity for

feeling greater still, and this gave her imagination, temperament, and--

though it would have shocked her to know it--a certain credulity, easily

transmutable into superstition.  Yet, as her sympathies were, to some

extent, rationalised by stern fact and everlasting custom, her opposition

to some things became more active and more fervid.



Looking into the distance, she saw two or three hundred men at work on a

canal, draining the property of Selamlik Pasha, whose tyrannies,

robberies, and intrigues were familiar to all Egypt, whose palaces were

almost as many as those of the notorious Mouffetish.  These men she saw

now working in the dread corvee had been forced from their homes by a

counterfeit Khedivial order.  They had been compelled to bring their own

tools, and to feed and clothe and house themselves, without pay or

reward, having left behind them their own fields untilled, their own

dourha unreaped, their date-palms, which the tax-gatherer confiscated.

Many and many a time--unless she was prevented, and this at first had

been often--she had sent food and blankets to these poor creatures who,

their day's work done, prayed to God as became good Mahommedans, and,

without covering, stretched themselves out on the bare ground to sleep.



It suggested that other slavery, which did not hide itself under the

forms of conscription and corvee.  It was on this slavery her mind had

been concentrated, and against it she had turned her energies and her

life.  As she now sat, pen in hand, the thought of how little she had

done, how futile had been all her crusade, came to her.  Yet there was,

too, a look of triumph in her eyes.  Until three days ago she had seen

little result from her labours.  Then had come a promise of better

things.  From the Englishman, against whom she had inveighed, had been

sent an olive branch, a token--of conversion?  Had he not sent six slaves

for her to free, and had she not freed them?  That was a step.  She

pictured to herself this harsh expatriated adventurer, this desert ruler,

this slave-holder--had he been a slave-dealer she could herself have

gladly been his executioner--surrounded by his black serfs, receiving her

letter.  In her mind's eye she saw his face flush as he read her burning

phrases, then turn a little pale, then grow stern.



She saw him, after a sleepless night, haunted by her warnings, her appeal

to his English manhood.  She saw him rise, meditative and relenting, and

send forthwith these slaves for her to free.  Her eye glistened again,

as it had shone while she had written of this thing to the British Consul

at Cairo, to her father in England, who approved of her sympathies and

lamented her actions.  Had her crusade been altogether fruitless, she

asked herself.  Ismail's freed Circassian was in her household, being

educated like an English girl, lifted out of her former degradation, made

to understand ""a higher life""; and yesterday she had sent away six

liberated slaves, with a gold-piece each, as a gift from a free woman to

free men.  It seemed to her for a moment now, as she sat musing and

looking, that her thirty years of life had not been--rather, might not

be-in vain.



There was one other letter she would write--to Donovan Pasha, who had not

been ardent in her cause, yet who might have done so much through his

influence with Ismail, who, it was said, liked him better than any

Englishman he had known, save Gordon.  True, Donovan Pasha had steadily

worked for the reduction of the corvee, and had, in the name of the

Khedive, steadily reduced private corvee, but he had never set his face

against slavery, save to see that no slave-dealing was permitted below

Assouan.  Yet, with her own eyes she had seen Abyssinian slaves sold

in the market-place of Assiout.  True, when she appealed to him, Donovan

Pasha had seen to it that the slave-dealers were severely punished, but

the fact remained that he was unsympathetic on the large issue.  When

appealed to, the British Consul had petulantly told her that Donovan

Pasha was doing more important work.  Yet she could only think of England

as the engine of civilisation, as an evangelising power, as the John the

Baptist of the nations--a country with a mission.  For so beautiful a

woman, of so worldly a stock, of a society so in the front of things, she

had some Philistine notions, some quite middle-class ideals.  It was like

a duchess taking to Exeter Hall; but few duchesses so afflicted had been

so beautiful and so young, so much of the worldly world--her father was

high in the household of an illustrious person.  .  .  .  If she could

but make any headway against slavery--she had as disciples ten Armenian

pashas, several wealthy Copts, a number of Arab sheikhs, and three

Egyptian princes, sympathetic rather than active--perhaps, through her

father, she might be able to move the illustrious person, and so, in

time, the Government of England.



It was a delightful dream--the best she had imagined for many a day.  She

was roused from it by the scream of a whistle, and the hoonch-hoonch of a

sternwheel steamer.  A Government boat was hastening in to the bank,

almost opposite her house.  She picked up the field-glass from the

window-sill behind her, and swept the deck of the steamer.  There were

two figures in English dress, though one wore the tarboosh.  The figure

shorter and smaller than the other she recognised.  This was Donovan

Pasha.  She need not write her letter to him, then.  He would be sure to

visit her.  Disapprove of him as she did from one stand-point, he always

excited in her feelings of homesickness, of an old life, full of

interests--music, drama, art, politics, diplomacy, the court, the

hunting-field, the quiet house-party.  He troubled her in a way too,

for his sane certainty, set against her aspiring credulity, arrested,

even commanded, her sometimes.



Instinctively she put out her hand to gather in flying threads of hair,

she felt at the pearl fastening of her collar, she looked at her brown

shoes and her dress, and was satisfied.  She was spotless.  And never had

her face shone--really shone--to such advantage.  It had not now the

brilliant colours of the first years.  The climate, her work in hospital

building, her labours against slavery, had touched her with a little

whiteness.  She was none the less good to see.



Who was this striding along with Donovan Pasha, straight towards her

house?  No one she had ever seen in Egypt, and yet in manner like some

one she had seen before--a long time before.  Her mind flashed back

through the years to the time when she was a girl, and visited old

friends of her father in a castle looking towards Skaw Fell, above the

long valley of the Nidd.  A kind of mist came before her eyes now.



When she really saw again, they were at the steps of the veranda, and

Donovan Pasha's voice was greeting her.  Then, as, without a word but

with a welcoming smile, she shook hands with Dicky, her look was held,

first by a blank arrest of memory, then by surprise.



Dicky turned for his office of introduction but was stayed by the look

of amusement in his friend's face, and by the amazed recognition in that

of My Lady.  He stepped back with an exclamation, partly of chagrin.

He saw that this recognition was no coincidence, so far as the man was

concerned, though the woman had been surprised in a double sense.  He

resented the fact that Kingsley Bey had kept this from him--he had the

weakness of small-statured men and of diplomatic people who have

reputations for knowing and doing.  The man, all smiling, held out his

hand, and his look was quizzically humorous as he said:



""You scarcely looked to see me here, Lady May?""  Her voice trembled with

pleasure.  ""No, of course.  When did you come, Lord Selden?  .  .  .

Won't you sit down?""



That high green terrace of Cumberland, the mist on Skaw Fell, the sun out

over the sea, they were in her eyes.  So much water had gone under the

bridges since!



""I was such a young girl then--in short frocks--it was a long time ago,

I fear,"" she added, as if in continuation of the thought flashing through

her mind.  ""Let me see,"" she went on fearlessly; ""I am thirty; that was

thirteen years ago.""



""I am thirty-seven, and still it is thirteen years ago.""



""You look older, when you don't smile,"" she added, and glanced at his

grey hair.



He laughed now.  She was far, far franker than she was those many years

ago, and it was very agreeable and refreshing.  ""Donovan, there, reproved

me last night for frivolity,"" he said.



""If Donovan Pasha has become grave, then there is hope for Egypt,"" she

said, turning to Dicky with a new brightness.



""When there's hope for Egypt, I'll have lost my situation, and there'll

be reason for drawing a long face,"" said Dicky, and got the two at such

an angle that he could watch them to advantage.  ""I thrive while it's

opera boufe.  Give us the legitimate drama, and I go with Ismail.""



The lady shrank a little.  ""If it weren't you, Donovan Pasha, I should

say that, associated with Ismail, as you are, you are as criminal as he.""



""What is crime in one country, is virtue in another,"" answered Dicky.

""I clamp the wheel sometimes to keep it from spinning too fast.  That's

my only duty.  I am neither Don Quixote nor Alexander Imperator.""



She thought he was referring obliquely to the corvee and the other thing

in which her life-work was involved.  She became severe.  ""It is

compromising with evil,"" she said.



""No.  It's getting a breakfast-roll instead of the whole bakery,"" he

answered.



""What do you think?"" she exclaimed, turning to Kingsley.



""I think there's one man in Egypt who keeps the boiler from bursting,"" he

answered.



""Oh, don't think I undervalue his Excellency here,"" she said with a

little laugh.  ""It is because he is strong, because he matters so much,

that one feels he could do more.  Ismail thinks there is no one like him

in the world.""



""Except Gordon,"" interrupted Kingsley.



""Except Gordon, of course; only Gordon isn't in Egypt.  And he would do

no good in Egypt.  The officials would block his way.  It is only in the

Soudan that he could have a free hand, be of real use.  There, a man, a

real man, like Gordon, could show the world how civilisation can be

accepted by desert races, despite a crude and cruel religion and low

standards of morality.""



""All races have their social codes--what they call civilisation,""

rejoined Kingsley.  ""It takes a long time to get custom out of the blood,

especially when it is part of the religion.  I'm afraid that expediency

isn't the motto of those who try to civilise the Orient and the East.""



""I believe in struggling openly for principle,"" she observed a little

acidly.



""Have you succeeded?"" he asked, trying to keep his gravity.  ""How about

your own household, for instance?  Have you Christianised and civilised

your people--your niggers, and the others?""



She flushed indignantly, but held herself in control.  She rang a bell.

""I have no 'niggers,'"" she answered quietly.  ""I have some Berberine

servants, two fellah boatmen, an Egyptian gardener, an Arab cook, and a

Circassian maid.  They are, I think, devoted to me.""



A Berberine servant appeared.  ""Tea, Mahommed,"" she said.  ""And tell

Madame that Donovan Pasha is here.  My cousin admires his Excellency so

much,"" she added to Kingsley, laughing.  ""I have never had any real

trouble with them,"" she continued with a little gesture of pride towards

the disappearing Berberine.



""There was the Armenian,"" put in Dicky slyly; ""and the Copt sarraf.  They

were no credit to their Christian religion, were they?""



""That was not the fault of the religion, but of the generations of

oppression--they lie as a child lies, to escape consequences.  Had they

not been oppressed they would have been good Christians in practice as in

precept.""



""They don't steal as a child steals,"" laughed Dicky.



""Armenians are Oriental through and through.  They no more understand the

Christian religion than the Soudanese understand freedom.""



He touched the right note this time.  Kingsley flashed a half-startled,

half-humorous look at him; the face of the lady became set, her manner

delicately frigid.  She was about to make a quiet, severe reply, but

something overcame her, and her eyes, her face, suddenly glowed.  She

leaned forward, her hands clasped tightly on her knees--Kingsley could

not but note how beautiful and brown they were, capable, handsome,

confident hands--and, in a voice thrilling with feeling, said:



""What is there in the life here that gets into the eyes of Europeans and

blinds them?  The United States spent scores of thousands of lives to

free the African slave.  England paid millions, and sacrificed ministries

and men, to free the slave; and in England, you--you, Donovan Pasha, and

men like you, would be in the van against slavery.  Yet here, where

England has more influence than any other nation--""



""More power, not influence,"" Dicky interrupted smiling.



""Here, you endure, you encourage, you approve of it.  Here, an Englishman

rules a city of slaves in the desert and grows rich out of their labour.

What can we say to the rest of the world, while out there in the desert""

--her eyes swept over the grey and violet hills--""that man, Kingsley Bey,

sets at defiance his race, his country, civilisation, all those things in

which he was educated?  Egypt will not believe in English civilisation,

Europe will not believe in her humanity and honesty, so long as he

pursues his wicked course.""



She turned with a gesture of impatience, and in silence began to pour the

tea the servant had brought, with a message that Madame had a headache.

Kingsley Bey was about to speak--it was so unfair to listen, and she

would forgive this no more readily than she would forgive slavery.  Dicky

intervened, however.



""He isn't so black as he's painted, personally.  He's a rash, inflammable

sort of fellow, who has a way with the native--treats him well, too,

I believe.  Very flamboyant, doomed to failure, so far as his merit is

concerned, but with an incredible luck.  He gambled, and he lost a dozen

times; and then gambled again, and won.  That's the truth, I fancy.  No

real stuff in him whatever.""



Their hostess put down her tea-cup, and looked at Dicky in blank

surprise.  Not a muscle in his face moved.  She looked at Kingsley.  He

had difficulty in restraining himself, but by stooping to give her fox-

terrier a piece of cake, he was able to conceal his consternation.



""I cannot--cannot believe it,"" she said slowly.  ""The British Consul does

not speak of him like that.""



""He is a cousin of the Consul,"" urged Dicky.  ""Cousin--what cousin?  I

never heard--he never told me that.""



""Oh, nobody tells anything in Egypt, unless he's kourbashed or thumb-

screwed.  It's safer to tell nothing, you know.""



""Cousin!  I didn't know there were Kingsleys in that family.  What reason

could the Consul have for hiding the relationship?""



""Well, I don't know, you must ask Kingsley.  Flamboyant and garrulous as

he is, he probably won't tell you that.""



""If I saw Kingsley Bey, I should ask him questions which interest me

more.  I should prefer, however, to ask them through a lawyer--to him in

the prisoner's dock.""



""You dislike him intensely?""



""I detest him for what he has done; but I do not despise him as you

suggest I should.  Flamboyant, garrulous--I don't believe that.  I think

him, feel him, to be a hard man, a strong man, and a bad man--if not

wholly bad.""



""Yet you would put him in the prisoner's dock,"" interposed Kingsley

musingly, and wondering how he was to tell her that Lord Selden and

Kingsley Bey were one and the same person.



""Certainly.  A man who commits public wrongs should be punished.  Yet I

am sorry that a man so capable should be so inhuman.""



""Your grandfather was inhuman,"" put in Kingsley.  ""He owned great West

Indian slave properties.



""He was culpable, and should have been punished--and was; for we are all

poor at last.  The world has higher, better standards now, and we should

live up to them.  Kingsley Bey should live up to them.""



""I suppose we might be able to punish him yet,"" said Dicky meditatively.

""If Ismail turned rusty, we could soon settle him, I fancy.  Certainly,

you present a strong case.""  He peered innocently into the distance.



""But could it be done--but would you?"" she asked, suddenly leaning

forward.  ""If you would, you could--you could!""



""If I did it at all, if I could make up my mind to it, it should be done

thoroughly--no half measures.""



""What would be the whole measures?"" she asked eagerly, but with a

certain faint shrinking, for Dicky seemed cold-blooded.



""Of course you never could tell what would happen when Ismail throws the

slipper.  This isn't a country where things are cut and dried, and done

according to Hoyle.  You get a new combination every time you pull a

string.  Where there's no system and a thousand methods you have to run

risks.  Kingsley Bey might get mangled in the machinery.""



She shrank a little.  ""It is all barbarous.""



""Well, I don't know.  He is guilty, isn't he?  You said you would like to

see him in the prisoner's dock.  You would probably convict him of

killing as well as slavery.  You would torture him with prison, and then

hang him in the end.  Ismail would probably get into a rage--pretended,

of course--and send an army against him.  Kingsley would make a fight for

it, and lose his head--all in the interest of a sudden sense of duty on

the part of the Khedive.  All Europe would applaud--all save England, and

what could she do?  Can she defend slavery?  There'll be no kid-gloved

justice meted out to Kingsley by the Khedive, if he starts a campaign

against him.  He will have to take it on the devil's pitchfork.  You must

be logical, you know.



""You can't have it both ways.  If he is to be punished, it must be after

the custom of the place.  This isn't England.""



She shuddered slightly, and Dicky went on: ""Then, when his head's off,

and his desert-city and his mines are no more, and his slaves change

masters, comes a nice question.  Who gets his money?  Not that there's

any doubt about who'll get it, but, from your standpoint, who should get

it?""



She shook her head in something like embarrassment.



""Money got by slavery--yes, who should get it?"" interposed Kingsley

carefully, for her eyes had turned to him for help.  ""Would you favour

his heirs getting it?  Should it go to the State?  Should it go to the

slaves?  Should it go to a fund for agitation against slavery?  .  .  .

You, for instance, could make use of a fortune like his in a cause like

that, could you not?"" he asked with what seemed boyish simplicity.



The question startled her.  ""I--I don't know.  .  .  .  But certainly

not,"" she hastened to add; ""I couldn't touch the money.  It is absurd--

impossible.""



""I can't see that,"" steadily persisted Kingsley.  ""This money was made

out of the work of slaves.  Certainly they were paid--they were, weren't

they?"" he asked with mock ignorance, turning to Dicky, who nodded assent.

""They were paid wages by Kingsley--in kind, I suppose, but that's all

that's needed in a country like the Soudan.  But still they had to work,

and their lives and bodies were Kingsley's for the time being, and the

fortune wouldn't have been made without them; therefore, according to the

most finely advanced theories of labour and ownership, the fortune is

theirs as much as Kingsley's.  But, in the nature of things, they

couldn't have the fortune.  What would they do with it?  Wandering tribes

don't need money.  Barter and exchange of things in kind is the one form

of finance in the Soudan.  Besides, they'd cut each other's throats the

very first day they got the fortune, and it would strew the desert sands.

It's all illogical and impossible--""



""Yes, yes, I quite see that,"" she interposed.



""But you surely can see how the fortune could be applied to saving those

races from slavery.  What was wrung from the few by forced labour and

loss of freedom could be returned to the many by a sort of national

salvation.  You could spend the fortune wisely--agents and missionaries

everywhere; in the cafes, in the bazaars, in the palace, at court.

Judicious gifts: and, at last, would come a firman or decree putting down

slavery, on penalty of death.  The fortune would all go, of course, but

think of the good accomplished!""



""You mean that the fortune should be spent in buying the decree--in

backsheesh?"" she asked bewildered, yet becoming indignant.



""Well, it's like company promoting,"" Dicky interposed, hugely enjoying

the comedy, and thinking that Kingsley had put the case shrewdly.  It was

sure to confuse her.  ""You have to clear the way, as it were.  The

preliminaries cost a good deal, and those who put the machinery in

working order have to be paid.  Then there's always some important person

who holds the key of the situation; his counsel has to be asked.  Advice

is very expensive.""



""It is gross and wicked!"" she flashed out.



""But if you got your way?  If you suppressed Kingsley Bey, rid the world

of him--well, well, say, banished him,"" he quickly added, as he saw her

fingers tremble--"" and got your decree, wouldn't it be worth while?  Fire

is fought with fire, and you would be using all possible means to do what

you esteem a great good.  Think of it--slavery abolished, your work

accomplished, Kingsley Bey blotted out!""



Light and darkness were in her face at once.  Her eyes were bright, her

brows became knitted, her foot tapped the floor.  Of course it was all

make-believe, this possibility, but it seemed too wonderful to think of

--slavery abolished, and through her; and Kingsley Bey, the renegade

Englishman, the disgrace to his country, blotted out.



""Your argument is not sound in many ways,"" she said at last, trying to

feel her course.  ""We must be just before all.  The whole of the fortune

was not earned by slaves.  Kingsley Bey's ability and power were the

original cause of its existence.  Without him there would have been no

fortune.  Therefore, it would not be justice to give it, even indirectly,

to the slaves for their cause.""



""It would be penalty--Kingsley Bey's punishment,"" said Dicky slyly.



""But I thought he was to be blotted out,"" she said ironically, yet

brightening, for it seemed to her that she was proving herself

statesmanlike, and justifying her woman's feelings as well.



""When he is blotted out, his fortune should go where it can remedy the

evil of his life.""



""He may have been working for some good cause,"" quietly put in Kingsley.

""Should not that cause get the advantage of his 'ability and power,' as

you have called it, even though he was mistaken, or perverted, or cruel?

Shouldn't an average be struck between the wrong his 'ability and power'

did and the right that same 'ability and power' was intended to advance?""



She turned with admiration to Kingsley.  ""How well you argue--I remember

you did years ago.  I hate slavery and despise and hate slave-dealers and

slave-keepers, but I would be just, too, even to Kingsley Bey.  But what

cause, save his own comfort and fortune, would he be likely to serve?

Do you know him?"" she added eagerly.



""Since I can remember,"" answered Kingsley, looking through the field-

glasses at a steamer coming up the river.



""Would you have thought that he would turn out as he has?"" she asked

simply.  ""You see, he appears to me so dark and baleful a figure that I

cannot quite regard him as I regard you, for instance.  I could not

realise knowing such a man.""



""He had always a lot of audacity,"" Kingsley replied slowly, ""and he

certainly was a schemer in his way, but that came from his helpless

poverty.""



""Was he very poor?"" she asked eagerly.



""Always.  And he got his estates heavily encumbered.  Then there were

people--old ladies--to have annuities, and many to be provided for, and

there was little chance in England for him.  Good-temper and brawn

weren't enough.""



""Egypt's the place for mother-wit,"" broke in Dicky.  ""He had that anyhow.

As to his unscrupulousness, of course that's as you may look at it.""



""Was he always unscrupulous?"" she asked.  ""I have thought him cruel and

wicked nationally--un-English, shamefully culpable; but a man who is

unscrupulous would do mean low things, and I should like to think that

Kingsley is a villain with good points.  I believe he has them, and I

believe that deep down in him is something English and honourable after

all--something to be reckoned with, worked on, developed.  See, here is a

letter I had from him two days ago""--she drew it from her pocket and

handed it over to Dicky.  ""I cannot think him hopeless altogether .  .  .

I freed the slaves who brought the letter, and sent them on to Cairo.  Do

you not feel it is hopeful?"" she urged, as Dicky read the letter slowly,

making sotto voce remarks meanwhile.



""Brigands and tyrants can be gallant--there are plenty of instances on

record.  What are six slaves to him?""



""He has a thousand to your one,"" said Kingsley slowly, and as though not

realising his words.



She started, sat up straight in her chair, and looked at him indignantly.

""I have no slaves,"" she said.



Kingsley Bey had been watching the Circassian girl Mata, in the garden

for some time, and he had not been able to resist the temptation to make

the suggestion that roused her now.



""I think the letter rather high-flown,"" said Dicky, turning the point,

and handing the open page to Kingsley.  ""It looks to me as though written

with a purpose.""



""What a cryptic remark!"" said Kingsley laughing, yet a little chagrined.

""What you probably wish to convey is that it says one thing and means

another.""



""Suppose it does,"" interposed the lady.  ""The fact remains that he

answered my appeal, which did not mince words, in most diplomatic and

gentlemanly language.  What do you think of the letter?"" she asked,

turning to Kingsley, and reaching a hand for it.



""I'll guarantee our friend here could do no better, if he sat up all

night,"" put in Dicky satirically.



""You are safe in saying so, the opportunity being lacking.""  She laughed,

and folded it up.



""I believe Kingsley Bey means what he says in that letter.  Whatever his

purpose, I honestly think that you might have great influence over him,""

mused Dicky, and, getting up, stepped from the veranda, as though to go

to the bank where an incoming steamer they had been watching was casting

anchor.  He turned presently, however, came back a step and said ""You

see, all our argument resolves itself into this: if Kingsley is to be

smashed only Ismail can do it.  If Ismail does it, Kingsley will have

the desert for a bed, for he'll not run, and Ismail daren't spare him.

Sequel, all his fortune will go to the Khedive.  Question, what are we

going to do about it?""



So saying he left them, laughing, and went down the garden-path to the

riverside.  The two on the veranda sat silent for a moment, then Kingsley

spoke.



""These weren't the things we talked about when we saw the clouds gather

over Skaw Fell and the sun shine on the Irish Sea.  We've done and seen

much since then.  Multitudes have come and gone in the world--and I have

grown grey!"" he added with a laugh.



""I've done little-nothing, and I meant and hoped to do much,"" she almost

pleaded.  ""I've grown grey too.""



""Not one grey hair,"" he said, with an admiring look.  ""Grey in spirit

sometimes,"" she reflected with a tired air.  ""But you--forgive me, if I

haven't known what you've done.  I've lived out of England so long.  You

may be at the head of the Government, for all I know.  You look to me as

though you'd been a success.  Don't smile.  I mean it.  You look as

though you'd climbed.  You haven't the air of an eldest son whose way is

cut out for him, with fifty thousand a year for compensation.  What have

you been doing?  What has been your work in life?""



""The opposite of yours.""



He felt himself a ruffian, but he consoled himself with the thought that

the end at which he aimed was good.  It seemed ungenerous to meet her

simple honesty by such obvious repartee, but he held on to see where the

trail would lead.



""That doesn't seem very clear,"" she said in answer.  ""Since I came out

here I've been a sort of riverine missionary, an apostle with no

followers, a reformer with a plan of salvation no one will accept.""



""We are not stronger than tradition, than the long custom of ages bred

in the bone and practised by the flesh.  You cannot change a people by

firmans; you must educate them.  Meanwhile, things go on pretty much the

same.  You are a generation before your time.  It is a pity, for you have

saddened your youth, and you may never live to see accomplished what you

have toiled for.""



""Oh, as to that--as to that .  .  .""  She smoothed back her hair lightly,

and her eyes wandered over the distant hills-mauve and saffron and opal,

and tender with the mist of evening.  ""What does it matter!"" she added.

""There are a hundred ways to live, a hundred things to which one might

devote one's life.  And as the years went on we'd realise how every form

of success was offset by something undone in another direction, something

which would have given us joy and memory and content--so it seems.  But--

but we can only really work out one dream, and it is the working out--

a little or a great distance--which satisfies.  I have no sympathy with

those who, living out their dreams, turn regretfully to another course or

another aim, and wonder-wonder, if a mistake hasn't been made.  Nothing

is a mistake which comes of a good aim, of the desire for wrongs righted,

the crooked places made straight.  Nothing matters so that the dream was

a good one and the heart approves and the eyes see far.""



She spoke as though herself in a dream, her look intent on the glowing

distance, as though unconscious of his presence.



""It's good to have lived among mountains and climbed them when you were

young.  It gives you bigger ideas of things.  You could see a long way

with the sun behind you, from Skaw Fell.""



He spoke in a low voice, and her eyes drew back from the distance and

turned on him.  She smiled.



""I don't know.  I suppose it gives one proportion, though I've been told

by Donovan Pasha and the Consul that I have no sense of proportion.  What

difference does it make?  It is the metier of some people of this world

to tell the truth, letting it fall as it will, and offend where it will,

to be in a little unjust maybe, measure wrongly here and there, lest the

day pass and nothing be done.  It is for the world to correct, to adjust,

to organise, to regulate the working of the truth.  One person cannot do

all.""



Every minute made him more and more regretful, while it deepened his

feelings for her.  He saw how far removed was her mind from the sordid

views of things, and how sincere a philosophy governed her actions and

her mission.



He was about to speak, but she continued: ""I suppose I've done unwise

things from a worldly, a diplomatic, and a political point of view.

I've--I've broken my heart on the rock of the impossible, so my father

says.  .  .  .  But, no, I haven't broken my heart.  I have only given it

a little too much hope sometimes, too much disappointment at others.  In

any case--can one be pardoned for quoting poetry in these days?  I don't

know, I've been so long out of the world--



                   'Bruised hearts when all is ended,

                    Bear the better all after-stings;

                    Broken once, the citadel mended

                    Standeth through all things.'



I'm not--not hopeless, though I've had a long hard fight here in Egypt;

and I've done so little.""  .  .  .  She kept smoothing out the letter she

had had from Kingsley Bey, as though unconsciously.  ""But it is coming,

the better day.  I know it.  Some one will come who will do all that I

have pleaded for--stop the corvee and give the peasants a chance; stop

slavery, and purify the harem and start the social life on a higher

basis; remove a disgrace from the commerce of an afflicted land; remove

--remove once for all such men as Kingsley Bey; make it impossible for

fortunes to be made out of human flesh and blood.""  She had the rapt look

of the dreamer.  Suddenly she recovered her more worldly mood: ""What are

you doing here?"" she added.  ""Have you come to take up official life?

Have you some public position--of responsibility?  Ah, perhaps,""--she

laughed almost merrily,--""you are the very man; the great reformer.

Perhaps you think and feel as I do, though you've argued against me.

Perhaps you only wanted to see how real my devotion to this cause is.

Tell me, are you only a tourist--I was going to say idler, but I know you

are not; you have the face of a man who does things--are you tourist or

worker here?  What does Egypt mean to you?  That sounds rather non-

conformist, but Egypt, to me, is the saddest, most beautiful, most

mysterious place in the world.  All other nations, all other races, every

person in the world should be interested in Egypt.  Egypt is the lost

child of Creation--the dear, pitiful waif of genius and mystery of the

world.  She has kept the calendar of the ages--has outlasted all other

nations, and remains the same as they change and pass.  She has been the

watcher of the world, the one who looks on, and suffers, as the rest of

the nations struggle for and wound her in their turn.  What does Egypt

mean to you?  What would you do for her--anything?""



There was no more satirical laughter in his eyes.  He was deeply in

earnest, disturbed, even excited.  ""Egypt means everything in the world

to me.  I would do what I could for her.""



""What has she done for you?""



""She has brought me to you again--to make me know that what you were by

Skaw Fell all those years ago, you are now, and a thousand times more.""



She parried the dangerous meaning in his voice, refused to see the

tenderness in his manner.



""I'm very sorry to hear that,"" she added in a tone vainly trying to be

unconcerned.  ""It is a pity that our youth pursues us in forms so little

desirable.  .  .  .  Who are they?"" she added quickly, nodding towards

the shore, from which Dicky was coming with an Egyptian officer and a

squad of soldiers.



""H'm,"" he responded laughing, ""it looks like a matter of consequence.  A

Pasha, I should think, to travel with an escort like that.""



""They're coming here,"" she added, and, calling to her servant, ordered

coffee.



Suddenly Kingsley got to his feet, with a cry of consternation; but sat

down again smiling with a shrug of the shoulders.



""What is it?"" she asked, with something like anxiety, for she had seen

the fleeting suspicion in his look.



""I don't know,"" he answered lightly, and as though the suspicion had

gone.  He watched Dicky and his companions closely, however, though he

chatted unconcernedly while they stood in apparent debate, and presently

came on.  Dicky was whistling softly, but with an air of perplexity, and

he walked with a precision of step which told Kingsley of difficulty

ahead.  He had not long to wait, and as Dicky drew nearer and looked him

in the eyes, he came to his feet again, his long body gathering itself

slowly up, as though for deliberate action.  He felt trouble in the air,

matters of moment, danger for himself, though of precisely what sort was

not clear.  He took a step forward, as though to shield the lady from

possible affront.



""I fancy they want to see me,"" he said.  He recognised the officer--

Foulik Pasha of the Khedive's household.



The Pasha salaamed.  Dicky drew over to the lady, with a keen warning

glance at Kingsley.  The Pasha salaamed again, and Kingsley responded in

kind.  ""Good-day to you, Pasha,"" he said.



""May the dew of the morning bring flowers to your life, Excellency,"" was

the reply.  He salaamed now towards the lady, and Kingsley murmured his

name to her.



""Will you not be seated,"" she said, and touched a chair as though to sit

down, yet casting a doubtful glance at the squad of men and the brilliant

kavass drawn up near by.  The Pasha looked from one to the other, and

Kingsley spoke.



""What is it, Pasha?  Her ladyship doesn't know why she should be

honoured.""



""But that makes no difference,"" she interposed.  ""Here is coffee--ah,

that's right, cigarettes too!  But, yes, you will take my coffee, Pasha,""

she urged.



The insolent look which had gathered in the man's face cleared away.  He

salaamed, hesitated, and took the coffee, then salaamed again to her.



She had caught at a difficulty; an instinctive sense of peril had taken

possession of her; and, feeling that the danger was for the Englishman

who had come to her out of her old life, she had interposed a diplomatic

moment.  She wanted to gain time before the mystery broke over her.  She

felt something at stake for herself.  Premonition, a troubling of the

spirit, told her that she was in the presence of a crisis out of which

she would not come unchanged.



Dicky was talking now, helping her--asking the Pasha questions of his

journey up the river, of the last news from Europe, of the Khedive's

health, though he and Kingsley had only left Cairo a half-day before the

Pasha.



The officer thanked the lady and salaamed again, then turned towards

Kingsley.



""You wished to speak with me, perhaps, Pasha,"" said Kingsley.



""If a moment of your time may have so little honour, saadat el bey.""



Kingsley moved down the veranda shoulder to shoulder with the Pasha, and

the latter's men, responding to a glance, moved down also.  Kingsley saw,

but gave no heed.



""What's up, Pasha?"" he asked in a low voice.  ""The Khedive commands your

return to Cairo.""



""With you?""



""So, effendi.""



""Compulsion, eh?  I don't see quite.  I'm an Englishman, not a fellah.""



""But I have my commands, saadat el bey.""



""What's the row, Pasha?""



""Is it for the servant to know the mind of his master?""



""And if I don't go?""



The Pasha pointed to his men, and motioned towards the boat where forty

or fifty others showed.  ""Bosh, Pasha!  That's no reason.  That's

flummery, and you know and the Highness knows it.  That would have been

all very well in the desert, but this is not the desert, and I'm not

doing business with the Highness any more.  What's the penalty if I don't

go?""



""Twenty men will lose their heads to-morrow morning, a riot will occur,

the bank where much gold is will be broken into, some one will be made

poor, and--""



""Come, never mind twaddle about my money--we'll see about that.  Those

twenty men--my men?""



""Your men, saadat el bey.""



""They're seized?""



""They are in prison.""



""Where?""



""At Abdin Palace.""



Kingsley Bey had had a blow, but he was not dumfounded.  In Egypt, the

wise man is never surprised at anything, and Kingsley had gone from

experience to experience without dismay.  He realised the situation at

once.  The Khedive had been worked upon by some one in the circle, and

had put on this pressure, for purposes of backsheesh, or blackmail, or

whatever it might be called.  His mind was made up at once.



""Very well, Pasha.  Though there's no reason why I should go with you

except to suit myself.  You'll excuse me for a moment, please.""  He

turned back.  Meanwhile, Dicky had been distracting the mind of the lady

with evasive and cheerful suggestions of urgent business calling Kingsley

to Cairo.  He saw the plot that had been laid, and it made him very

angry, but nothing could be done until he met the Khedive.



He guessed who had filled the Khedive's mind with cupidity.  He had seen

old Selamlik Pasha, who had lent the Khedive much money, entering the

palace as he left with Kingsley Bey thirty-six hours before.  He had hope

that he could save the situation, but meanwhile he was concerned for the

new situation created here at Assiout.  What would Kingsley do?  He knew

what he himself would do in the circumstances, but in crises few men of

character do the necessary thing in exactly the same way.  Here was

comedy of a high order, a mystery and necessary revelation of singular

piquancy.  To his thinking the revelation was now overdue.



He looked at the woman beside him, and he saw in her face a look it never

had had before.  Revelation of a kind was there; beauty, imagination,

solicitude, delicate wonder were there.  It touched him.  He had never

been arrested on his way of life by any dream of fair women, or any dream

of any woman.  It did not seem necessary--no one was necessary to him;

he lived his real life alone, never sharing with any one that of himself

which was not part of the life he lived before the world.  Yet he had

always been liked by men, and he had been agreeable in the sight of more

women than he knew, this little man with a will of iron and a friendly

heart.  But he laughed silently now as he saw Kingsley approaching; the

situation was so beautifully invented.  It did not seem quite like a

thing in real life.  In any other country than Egypt it would have been

comic opera--Foulik Pasha and his men so egregiously important; Kingsley

so overwhelmed by the duty that lay before him; the woman in a

whimsically embarrassing position with the odds, the laugh, against her,

yet little likely to take the obvious view of things and so make possible

a commonplace end.  What would she do?  What would Kingsley do?  What

would he, Dicky Donovan, do?  He knew by the look in Kingsley's eyes that

it was time for him to go.  He moved down to Foulik Pasha, and, taking

his arm, urged him towards the shore with a whispered word.  The Pasha

responded, followed by his men, but presently turned and, before Dicky

could intervene--for he wanted Kingsley to make his own revelation--said

courteously:



""May the truth of Allah be with you, I will await you at the boat,

Kingsley Bey.""



Dicky did not turn round, but, with a sharp exclamation of profanity,

drew Foulik Pasha on his imbecile way.



As for Kingsley Bey, he faced a woman who, as the truth dawned upon her,

stared at him in a painful silence for a moment, and then drew back to

the doorway of the house as though to find sudden refuge.  Kingsley's

head went round.  Nothing had gone according to his anticipations.

Foulik Pasha had upset things.



""Now you know--I wished to tell you myself,"" he said.



She answered at once, quietly, coldly, and with an even formal voice:

""I did not know your name was Kingsley.""



""It was my grandmother's name.""



""I had forgotten--that is of no consequence, however; but--"" she stopped.



""You realise that I am--""



""Yes, of course, Kingsley Bey--I quite understand.  I thought you Lord

Selden, an English gentleman.  You are--"" she made an impatient gesture--

""well, you are English still!""



He was hit hard.  The suggestion of her voice was difficult to bear.



""I am not so ungentlemanly as you think.  I meant to tell you--almost at

once.  I thought that as an old friend I might wait a moment or two.  The

conversation got involved, and it grew harder every minute.  Then Foulik

Pasha came-and now.  .  .  .""



She showed no signs of relenting.  ""It was taking advantage of an old-

acquaintance.  Against your evil influence here I have been working for

years, while you have grown rich out of the slavery I detest.  You will

pardon my plain speaking, but this is not London, and one has had to

learn new ways in this life here.  I do not care for the acquaintance of

slave-drivers, I have no wish to offer them hospitality.  The world is

large and it belongs to other people, and one has to endure much when one

walks abroad; but this house is my own place, a little spot all my own,

and I cherish it.  There are those who come to the back door, and they

are fed and clothed and sent away by the hand of charity; there are those

who come to the front door, and I welcome them gladly--all that I have is

theirs; there are those who come to a side door, when no one sees, and

take me unawares, and of them I am afraid, their presence I resent.  My

doors are not open to slave-drivers.""



""What is the difference between the letter from the slave-driver's hand

and the slave-driver himself?""



She started and flushed deeply.  She took the letter slowly from her

pocket and laid it on the table.



""I thought it a letter from a man who was openly doing wrong, and who

repented a little of his wrongdoing.  I thought it a letter from a

stranger, from an Englishman who, perhaps, had not had such advantages

of birth and education as came to you.""



""Yet you had a good opinion of the letter.  There seemed no want of

education and all that there--won't you be reasonable, and let me

explain?  Give me half a chance.""



""I do not see that explanation can mend anything.  The men you sent me to

free: that was a-well, call it a manoeuvre, to achieve what, I cannot

tell.  Is it not so?  The men are not free.  Is it not so?""



""I am afraid they are not free,"" he answered, smiling in spite of

himself.



""Your coming here was a manoeuvre also--for what purpose I do not know.

Yet it was a manoeuvre, and I am--or was to be--the victim of the plot.""

She smiled scornfully.  ""I trust you may yet be the victim of your own

conduct.""



""In more ways than one, maybe.  Don't you think, now that the tables are

turned, that you might have mercy on 'a prisoner and a captive'?""



She looked at him inquiringly, then glanced towards the shore where Dicky

stood talking with Foulik Pasha.  Her eyes came back slowly and again

asked a question.  All at once intelligence flashed into them.



""You wished to see Kingsley Bey a prisoner; you have your wish,"" he said

smiling.



""Whose prisoner?"" she asked, still coldly.  ""The Khedive's.""



A flash of triumph crossed her face.  Her heart beat hard.  Had it come

at last, the edict to put down slavery?  Had the Khedive determined to

put an end to the work of Kingsley Bey in his desert-city-and to Kingsley

Bey himself?  .  .  .  Her heart stopped beating now.  She glanced

towards Dicky Donovan, and her pulses ran more evenly again.  Would the

Khedive have taken such a step unless under pressure?  And who in Egypt

could have, would have, persuaded him, save Dicky Donovan?  Yet Dicky was

here with his friend Kingsley Bey.  The mystery troubled her, and the

trouble got into her eyes.



""You are going to Cairo?"" she said, glancing towards the boat.



""It would seem so.""



""And Donovan Pasha goes too?""



""I hope so.  I am not sure.""



""But he must go,"" she said a little sharply.



""Yes?""



""He--you must have somebody, and he has great power.""



""That might or might not be to my benefit.  After all, what does it

matter?""--He saw that she was perturbed, and he pressed his advantage.



She saw, however, and retreated.  ""We reap as we sow,"" she said, and made

as if to go inside the house.  ""You have had the game, you must pay for

the candles out of your earnings.""



""I don't mind paying what's fair.  I don't want other people to pay.""



She turned angrily on him, he could not tell why.  ""You don't want others

to pay!  As if you could do anything that doesn't affect others.  Did you

learn that selfishness at Skaw Fell, or was it born with you?  You are of

those who think they earn all their own success and happiness, and then,

when they earn defeat and despair, are surprised that others suffer.  As

if our penalties were only paid by ourselves!  Egotism, vanity!  So long

as you have your dance, it matters little to you who pays for the tune.""



""I am sorry.""  He was bewildered; he had not expected this.



""Does a man stoop to do in a foreign land what he would not do in his own

country--dare not do?--One is so helpless--a woman!  Under cover of an

old friend ship--ah!""  She suddenly turned, and, before he could say a

word, disappeared inside the house.  He spoke her name once, twice; he

ventured inside the house, and called, but she did not come.  He made his

way to the veranda, and was about to leave for the shore, when he heard a

step behind him.  He turned quickly.  It was the Circassian girl, Mata.



He spoke to her in Arabic, and she smiled at him.  ""What is it?"" he

asked, for he saw she had come from her mistress.



""My Lady begs to excuse--but she is tired,"" she said in English, which

she loved to use.



""I am to go on--to prison, then?""



""I suppose.  It has no matter.  My Lady is angry.  She has to say, 'Thank

you, good-bye.'  So, goodbye,"" she added naively, and held out her hand.



Kingsley laughed, in spite of his discomfiture, and shook it.



""Who are you?"" he asked.



""I am My Lady's slave,"" she said proudly.



""No, no--her servant.  You can come and go as you like.  You have wages.""



""I am Mata, the slave--My Lady's slave.  All the world knows I am her

slave.  Was I not given her by the Khedive whose slave I was?  May the

leaves of life be green always, but I am Mata the slave,"" she said

stubbornly, shaking her head.



""Do you tell My Lady so?""



""Wherefore should I tell My Lady what she knows?  Is not the truth the

truth?  Good-night!  I had a brother who went to prison.  His grave is by

Stamboul.  Good-night, effendi.  He was too young to die, but he had

gold, and the captain of the citadel needed money.  So, he had to die.

Malaish!  He is in the bosom of God, and prison does not last forever.

Goodnight, effendi.  If you, effendi, are poor, it is well; no man will

desire your life.  Then you can be a slave, and have quiet nights.  If

you are rich, effendi, remember my brother.  Good-night, effendi.  May

sacrifices be yours .  .  .  and My Lady says good-night.""  Kingsley gave

her a gold-piece and went down to Foulik Pasha.



As they steamed away Kingsley looked in vain to the house on the shore.

There was no face at window or door, no sign of life about the place.



""Well, my bold bey,"" said Donovan Pasha to him at last, ""what do you

think of Egypt now?""



""I'm not thinking of Egypt now.""



""Did the lady deeply sympathise?  Did your prescription work?""



""You know it didn't.  Nothing worked.  This fool Foulik came at the wrong

moment.""



""It wouldn't have made any difference.  You see you were playing with

marked cards, and that is embarrassing.  You got a certificate of

character by--""



""Yes, I know.  That's what she said.  Never mind.  I've played as I meant

to play, and I'll abide the result.  I said I'd marry her, and I mean to,

though she gently showed me the door--beautiful, proud person!""



""She is much too good for you.""



""What does that matter, if she doesn't think so?""



""My opinion is she'll never touch you or your slave-gold with a mile-

measure.""



Dicky did not think this, but it was his way of easing his own mind.

Inwardly he was studying the situation, and wondering how he could put

Kingsley's business straight.



""She thinks I'm still a 'slave-driver,' as she calls it--women are so

innocent.  You did your part, as well as could be expected, I'm bound to

say.  I only wish I wasn't so much trouble to you.  I owe you a lot,

Dicky Pasha--everything!  You got me the golden shillings to start with;

you had faith in me; you opened the way to fortune, to the thing that's

more than fortune--to success.""



""I'm not altogether proud of you.  You've messed things to-day.""



""I'll set them right to-morrow--with your help.  Ismail is going a bit

large this time.""



""He is an Oriental.  A life or two--think of Sadik Pasha.  Your men--""



""Well?  You think he'd do it--think he'd dare to do it?""



""Suppose they disappeared?  Who could prove that Ismail did it?  And if

it could be proved--they're his own subjects, and the Nile is near!  Who

can say him nay?""



""I fancy you could--and I would.""



""I can do something.  I've done a little in my day; but my day, like

Ismail's, is declining.  They are his subjects, and he needs money, and

he puts a price on their heads--that's about the size of it.  Question

How much will you have to pay?  How much have you in Cairo at the bank?""



""Only about ten thousand pounds.""



""He'd take your draft on England, but he'll have that ten thousand

pounds, if he can get it.""



""That doesn't matter, but as for my arrest--""



""A trick, on some trumped-up charge.  If he can hold you long enough

to get some of your cash, that's all he wants.  He knows he's got no

jurisdiction over you--not a day's hold.  He knows you'd give a good deal

to save your men.""



""Poor devils!  But to be beaten by this Egyptian bulldozer--not if I know

it, Dicky""



""Still, it may be expensive.""



""Ah!"" Kingsley Bey sighed, and his face was clouded, but Dicky knew he

was not thinking of Ismail or the blackmail.  His eyes were on the house

by the shore, now disappearing, as they rounded a point of land.



""Ah"" said Donovan Pasha, but he did not sigh.









III



""Ah!"" said a lady, in a dirty pink house at Assiout, with an accent

which betrayed a discovery and a resolution, ""I will do it.  I may be of

use some way or another.  The Khedive won't dare--but still the times are

desperate.  As Donovan Pasha said, it isn't easy holding down the safety-

valve all the time, and when it flies off, there will be dark days for

all of us.  .  .  .  An old friend--bad as he is!  Yes, I will go.""



Within forty-eight hours of Donovan Pasha's and Kingsley Bey's arrival in

Cairo the lady appeared there, and made inquiries of her friends.  No one

knew anything.  She went to the Consulate, and was told that Kingsley Bey

was still in prison, that the Consulate had not yet taken action.



She went to Donovan Pasha, and he appeared far more mysterious and

troubled than he really was.  Kingsley Bey was as cheerful as might be

expected, he said, but the matter was grave.  He was charged with the

destruction of the desert-city, and maintaining an army of slaves in the

Khedive's dominions--a menace to the country.



""But it was with the Khedive's connivance,"" she said.  ""Who can prove

that?  It's a difficult matter for England to handle, as you can see.""



This was very wily of Dicky Donovan, for he was endeavouring to create

alarm and sympathy in the woman's mind by exaggerating the charge.  He

knew that in a few days at most Kingsley Bey would be free.  He had

himself given Ismail a fright, and had even gone so far as to suggest

inside knowledge of the plans of Europe concerning Egypt.  But if he

could deepen the roots of this comedy for Kingsley's benefit--and for the

lady's--it was his duty so to do.



""Of course,"" he made haste to add, ""you cannot be expected to feel

sympathy for him.  In your eyes, he is a criminal.  He had a long

innings, and made a mint of money.  We must do all we can, and, of

course, we'll save his life--ah, I'm sure you wouldn't exact the fullest

penalty on him!""



Dicky was more than wily; he was something wicked.  The suggestion of

danger to Kingsley's life had made her wince, and he had added another

little barbed arrow to keep the first company.  The cause was a good one.

Hurt now to heal afterwards--and Kingsley was an old friend, and a good

fellow.  Anyhow, this work was wasting her life, and she would be much

better back in England, living a civilised life, riding in the Row, and

slumming a little, in the East End, perhaps, and presiding at meetings

for the amelioration of the unameliorated.  He was rather old-fashioned

in his views.  He saw the faint trouble in her eyes and face, and he made

up his mind that he would work while it was yet the day.  He was about to

speak, but she suddenly interposed a question.



""Is he comfortable?  How does he take it?""



""Why, all right.  You know the kind of thing: mud walls and floor--quite

dry, of course--and a sleeping-mat, and a balass of water, and cakes of

dourha, and plenty of time to think.  After all, he's used to primitive

fare.""



Donovan Pasha was drawing an imaginary picture, and drawing it with

effect.  He almost believed it as his artist's mind fashioned it.  She

believed it, and it tried her.  Kingsley Bey was a criminal, of course,

but he was an old friend; he had offended her deeply also, but that was

no reason why he should be punished by any one save herself.  Her regimen

of punishments would not necessarily include mud walls and floor, and a

sleeping-mat and a balass of water; and whatever it included it should

not be administered by any hand save her own.  She therefore resented,

not quite unselfishly, this indignity and punishment the Khedive had

commanded.



""When is he to be tried?""



""Well, that is hardly the way to put it.  When he can squeeze the Khedive

into a corner he'll be free, but it takes time.  We have to go carefully,

for it isn't the slave-master alone, it's those twenty slaves of his,

including the six you freed.  Their heads are worth a good deal to the

Khedive, he thinks.""



She was dumfounded.  ""I don't understand,"" she said helplessly.



""Well, the Khedive put your six and fourteen others in prison for treason

or something--it doesn't matter much here what it is.  His game is to

squeeze Kingsley's gold orange dry, if he can.""



A light broke over her face.  ""Ah, now I see,"" she said, and her face

flushed deeply with anger and indignation.  ""And you--Donovan Pasha, you

who are supposed to have influence with the Khedive, who are supposed to

be an English influence over him, you can speak of this quietly,

patiently, as a matter possible to your understanding.  This barbarous,

hideous black mail!  This cruel, dreadful tyranny!  You, an Englishman,

remain in the service of the man who is guilty of such a crime!""  Her

breath came hard.



""Well, it seems the wisest thing to do as yet.  You have lived a long

time in Egypt, you should know what Oriental rule is.  Question: Is one

bite of a cherry better than no bite of a cherry?  Egypt is like a

circus, but there are wild horses in the ring, and you can't ride them

just as you like.  If you keep them inside the barriers, that's

something.  Of course, Kingsley made a mistake in a way.  He didn't

start his desert-city and his slavery without the consent of the Khedive;

he shouldn't have stopped it and gone out of business without the same

consent.  It cut down the Effendina's tribute.""



He spoke slowly, counting every word, watching the effect upon her.  He

had much to watch, and he would have seen more if he had known women

better.



""He has abandoned the mines--his city--and slavery?"" she asked

chokingly, confusedly.  It seemed hard for her to speak.



""Yes, yes, didn't you know?  Didn't he tell you?""  She shook her head.

She was thinking back-remembering their last conversation, remembering

how sharp and unfriendly she had been with him.  He had even then freed

his slaves, had given her slaves to free.



""I wonder what made him do it?"" added Dicky.  ""He had made a great

fortune--poor devil, he needed it, for the estates were sweating under

the load.  I wonder what made him do it?""



She looked at him bewilderedly for a moment, then, suddenly, some faint

suspicion struck her.



""You should know.  You joined with him in deceiving me at Assiout.""



""But, no,"" he responded quickly, and with rare innocence, ""the situation

was difficult.  You already knew him very well, and it was the force of

circumstances--simply the force of circumstances.  Bad luck--no more.

He was innocent, mine was the guilt.  I confess I was enjoying the thing,

because--because, you see he had deceived me, actually deceived me, his

best friend.  I didn't know he knew you personally, till you two met on

that veranda at Assiout, and--""



""And you made it difficult for him to explain at once--I remember.""



""I'm afraid I did.  I've got a nasty little temper at times, and I had a

chance to get even.  Then things got mixed, and Foulik Pasha upset the

whole basket of plums.  Besides, you see, I'm a jealous man, an envious

man, and you never looked so well as you did that day, unless it's

to-day.""



She was about to interrupt him, but he went on.



""I had begun to feel that we might have been better friends, you and I;

that--that I might have helped you more; that you had not had the

sympathy you deserved; that civilisation was your debtor, and that--""



""No, no, no, you must not speak that way to me,"" she interposed with

agitation.  ""It--it is not necessary.  It doesn't bear on the matter.

And you've always been a good friend--always a good friend,"" she added

with a little friendly quiver in her voice, for she was not quite sure of

herself.



Dicky had come out in a new role, one wherein he would not have been

recognised.  It was probably the first time he had ever tried the

delicate social art of playing with fire of this sort.  It was all true

in a way, but only in a way.  The truest thing about it was that it was

genuine comedy, in which there were two villains, and no hero, and one

heroine.



""But there it is,"" he repeated, having gone as far as his cue warranted.

""I didn't know he had given up his desert-city till two days before you

did, and I didn't know he knew you, and I don't know why he gave up his

desert-city--do you?""



There was a new light in her eyes, a new look in her face.  She was not

sure but that she had a glimmering of the reason.  It was a woman's

reason, and it was not without a certain exquisite egotism and vanity,

for she remembered so well the letter she had written him--every word was

etched into her mind; and she knew by heart every word of his reply.

Then there were the six slaves he sent to her-and his coming immediately

afterwards.  .  .  .  For a moment she seemed to glow, and then the

colour slowly faded and left her face rather grey and very quiet.



He might not be a slave-driver now, but he had been one--and the world of

difference it made to her!  He had made his great fortune out of the work

of the men employed as slaves, and--she turned away to the window with a

dejected air.  For the first time the real weight of the problem pressed

upon her heavily.



""Perhaps you would like to see him,"" said Dicky.  ""It might show that you

were magnanimous.""



""Magnanimous!  It will look like that--in a mud-cell, with mud floor, and

a piece of matting.""



""And a balass of water and dourha-cakes,"" said Dicky in a childlike way,

and not daring to meet her eyes.



He stroked his moustache with his thumb-nail in a way he had when

perplexed.  Kingsley Bey was not in a mud-cell, with a mat and a balass

of water, but in a very decent apartment indeed, and Dicky was trying to

work the new situation out in his mind.  The only thing to do was to have

Kingsley removed to a mud-cell, and not let him know the author of his

temporary misfortune and this new indignity.  She was ready to visit him

now--he could see that.  He made difficulties, however, which would

prevent their going at once, and he arranged with her to go to Kingsley

in the late afternoon.



Her mind was in confusion, but one thing shone clear through the

confusion, and it was the iniquity of the Khedive.  It gave her a

foothold.  She was deeply grateful for it.  She could not have moved

without it.  So shameful was the Khedive in her eyes that the prisoner

seemed Criminal made Martyr.



She went back to her hotel flaming with indignation against Ismail.

It was very comforting to her to have this resource.  The six slaves

whom she had freed--the first-fruits of her labours: that they should be

murdered!  The others who had done no harm, who had been slaves by

Ismail's consent, that they should be now in danger of their lives

through the same tyrant!  That Kingsley Bey, who had been a slave-master

with Ismail's own approval and to his advantage, should now--she glowed

with pained anger.  .  .  .  She would not wait till she had seen

Kingsley Bey, or Donovan Pasha again; she herself would go to Ismail

at once.



So, she went to Ismail, and she was admitted, after long waiting in an

anteroom.  She would not have been admitted at all, if it had not been

for Dicky, who, arriving just before her on the same mission, had seen

her coming, and guessed her intention.  He had then gone in to the

Khedive with a new turn to his purposes, a new argument and a new

suggestion, which widened the scope of the comedy now being played.

He had had a struggle with Ismail, and his own place and influence had

been in something like real danger, but he had not minded that.  He had

suggested that he might be of service to Egypt in London and Paris.  That

was very like a threat, but it was veiled by a look of genial innocence

which Ismail admired greatly.  He knew that Donovan Pasha could hasten

the crisis coming on him.  He did not believe that Donovan Pasha would,

but that did not alter the astuteness and value of the move; and,

besides, it was well to run no foolish risks and take no chances.  Also,

he believed in Donovan Pasha's honesty.  He despised him in a worldly

kind of way, because he might have been rich and splendid, and he was

poor and unassuming.  He wanted Kingsley Bey's fortune, or a great slice

of it, but he wanted it without a struggle with Dicky Donovan, and with

the British Consulate--for that would come, too, directly.  It gave him

no security to know that the French would be with him--he knew which

country would win in the end.  He was preying on Kingsley Bey's humanity,

and he hoped to make it well worth while.  And all he thought and planned

was well understood by Dicky.



Over their coffee they both talked from long distances towards the

point of attack and struggle, Ismail carelessly throwing in glowing

descriptions of the palaces he was building.  Dicky never failed to show

illusive interest, and both knew that they were not deceiving the other,

and both came nearer to the issue by devious processes, as though these

processes were inevitable.  At last Dicky suddenly changed his manner and

came straight to the naked crisis.



""Highness, I have an invitation for Kingsley Bey to dine at the British

Consulate to-night.  You can spare his presence?""



""My table is not despicable.  Is he not comfortable here?""



""Is a mud floor, with bread and water and a sleeping-mat, comfortable?""



""He is lodged like a friend.""



""He is lodged like a slave--in a cell.""



""They were not my orders.""



""Effendina, the orders were mine.""



""Excellency!""



""Because there were no orders and Foulik Pasha was sleepless with anxiety

lest the prisoner should escape, fearing your Highness's anger, I gave

orders and trusted your Highness to approve.""



Ismail saw a mystery in the words, and knew that it was all to be part of

Dicky's argument in the end.  ""So be it, Excellency,"" he said, ""thou hast

breathed the air of knowledge, thine actions shine.  In what quarter of

the palace rests he?  And Foulik Pasha?""



""Foulik Pasha sits by his door, and the room is by the doorway where the

sarrafs keep the accounts for the palaces your Highness builds.  Also,

abides near, the Greek, who toils upon the usury paid by your Highness

to Europe.""



Ismail smiled.  The allusions were subtle and piercing.  There was a

short pause.  Each was waiting.  Dicky changed the attack.  ""It is a pity

we should be in danger of riot at this moment, Highness.""



""If riots come, they come.  It is the will of God, Excellency.  But in

our hand lies order.  We will quiet the storm, if a storm fall.""



""There will be wreck somewhere.""



""So be it.  There will be salvage.""



""Nothing worth a riot, Highness.""



The Khedive eyed Dicky with a sudden malice and a desire to slay--to slay

even Donovan Pasha.  He did not speak, and Dicky continued negligently:

""Prevention is better than cure.""



The Khedive understood perfectly.  He knew that Dicky had circumvented

him, and had warned the Bank.



Still the Khedive did not speak.  Dicky went on.  ""Kingsley Bey deposited

ten thousand pounds--no more.  But the gold is not there; only Kingsley

Bey's credit.""



""His slaves shall die to-morrow morning.""



""Not so, Highness.""



The Khedive's fingers twisted round the chair-arm savagely.



""Who will prevent it?""



""Your Highness will.  Your Highness could not permit it--the time is far

past.  Suppose Kingsley Bey gave you his whole fortune, would it save one

palace or pay one tithe of your responsibilities?  Would it lengthen the

chain of safety?""



""I am safe.""



""No, Highness.  In peril--here with your own people, in Europe with the

nations.  Money will not save you.""



""What then?""



""Prestige.  Power--the Soudan.  Establish yourself in the Soudan with a

real army.  Let your name be carried to the Abyssinian mountains as the

voice of the eagle.""



""Who will carry it?""  He laughed disdainfully, with a bitter, hopeless

kind of pride.  ""Who will carry it?""



""Gordon-again.""



The Khedive started from his chair, and his sullen eye lighted to

laughter.  He paced excitedly to and fro for a minute, and then broke

out:



""Thou hast said it!  Gordon--Gordon--if he would but come again!--But it

shall be so, by the beard of God's prophet, it shall.  Thou hast said the

thing that has lain in my heart.  Have I had honour in the Soudan since

his feet were withdrawn?  Where is honour and tribute and gold since his

hand ruled--alone without an army?  It is so--Inshallah!  but it is so.

He shall come again, and the people's eyes will turn to Khartoum and

Darfdr and Kordofan, and the greedy nations will wait.  Ah, my friend,

but the true inspiration is thine!  I will send for Gordon to night--even

to-night.  Thou shalt go--no, no, not so.  Who can tell--I might look for

thy return in vain!  But who--who, to carry my word to Gordon?""



""Your messenger is in the anteroom,"" said Dicky with a sudden thought.



""Who is it, son of the high hills?""



""The lady at Assiout--she who is such a friend to Gordon as I am to thee,

Highness.""



""She whose voice and hand are against slavery?""



""Even so.  It is good that she return to England there to remain.  Send

her.""



""Why is she here?""  The Khedive looked suspiciously at Dicky, for it

seemed that a plot had been laid.



Thereupon, Dicky told the Khedive the whole story, and not in years had

Ismail's face shown such abandon of humour.



""By the will of God, but it shall be!"" he said.  ""She shall marry

Kingsley Bey, and he shall go free.""



""But not till she has seen him and mourned over him in his cell, with the

mud floor and the balass of water.""



The Khedive laughed outright and swore in French.  ""And the cakes of

dourha!  I will give her as a parting gift the twenty slaves, and she

shall bring her great work to a close in the arms of a slaver.  It is

worth a fortune.""



""It is worth exactly ten thousand pounds to your Highness--ten thousand

pounds neither more nor less.""



Ismail questioned.



""Kingsley Bey would make last tribute of thus much to your Highness.""



Ismail would not have declined ten thousand centimes.  ""Malaish!"" he

said, and called for coffee, while they planned what should be said to

his Ambassadress from Assiout.



She came trembling, yet determined, and she left with her eyes full of

joyful tears.  She was to carry the news of his freedom and the freedom

of his slaves to Kingsley Bey, and she--she, was to bear to Gordon, the

foe of slavery, the world's benefactor, the message that he was to come

and save the Soudan.  Her vision was enlarged, and never went from any

prince a more grateful supplicant and envoy.



Donovan Pasha went with her to the room with the mud floor where Kingsley

Bey was confined.



""I owe it all to you,"" she said as they hastened across the sun-swept

square.  ""Ah, but you have atoned!  You have done it all at once, after

these long years.""



""Well, well, the time is ripe,"" said Dicky piously.  They found Kingsley

Bey reading the last issue of the French newspaper published in Cairo.

He was laughing at some article in it abusive of the English, and seemed

not very downcast; but at a warning sign and look from Dicky, he became

as grave as he was inwardly delighted at seeing the lady of Assiout.



As Kingsley Bey and the Ambassadress shook hands, Dicky said to her:

""I'll tell him, and then go.""  Forthwith he said: ""Kingsley Bey, son of

the desert, and unhappy prisoner, the prison opens its doors.  No more

for you the cold earth for a bed--relieved though it be by a sleeping-

mat.  No more the cake of dourha and the balass of Nile water.

Inshallah, you are as free as a bird on the mountain top, to soar

to far lands and none to say thee nay.""



Kingsley Bey caught instantly at the meaning lying beneath Dicky's

whimsical phrases, and he deported himself accordingly.  He looked

inquiringly at the Ambassadress, and she responded:



""We come from the Khedive, and he bids us carry you his high

considerations--""



""Yes, 'high considerations,' he said,"" interjected Dicky with his eye

towards a fly on the ceiling.



""And to beg your company at dinner to-night.""



""And the price?"" asked Kingsley, feeling his way carefully, for he

wished no more mistakes where this lady was concerned.  At Assiout he had

erred; he had no desire to be deceived at Cairo.  He did not know how he

stood with her, though her visit gave him audacious hopes.  Her face was

ruled to quietness now, and only in the eyes resolutely turned away was

there any look which gave him assurance.  He seemed to hear her talking

from the veranda that last day at Assiout; and it made him discreet at

least.



""Oh, the price!"" murmured Dicky, and he seemed to study the sleepy

sarraf who pored over his accounts in the garden.  ""The price is

'England, home, and beauty.'  Also to prop up the falling towers of

Khedivia--ten thousand pounds!  Also, Gordon.""



Kingsley Bey appeared, as he was, mystified, but he was not inclined to

spoil things by too much speaking.  He looked inquiry.



At that moment an orderly came running towards the door--Dicky had

arranged for that.  Dicky started, and turned to the lady.  ""You tell

him.  This fellow is coming for me.  I'll be back in a quarter of an

hour.""  He nodded to them both and went out to the orderly, who followed

his footsteps to the palace.



""You've forgiven me for everything--for everything at Assiout, I mean?""

he asked.



""I have no desire to remember,"" she answered.  ""About Gordon--what is

it?""



""Ah, yes, about Gordon!""  She drew herself up a little.  ""I am to go to

England--for the Khedive, to ask Gordon to save the Soudan.""



""Then you've forgiven the Khedive?"" he inquired with apparent innocence.



""I've no wish to prevent him showing practical repentance,"" she answered,

keenly alive to his suggestion, and a little nettled.  ""It means no more

slavery.  Gordon will prevent that.""



""Will he?"" asked Kingsley, again with muffled mockery.



""He is the foe of slavery.  How many, many letters I have had from him!

He will save the Soudan--and Egypt too.""



""He will be badly paid--the Government will stint him.  And he will give

away his pay--if he gets any.""



She did not see his aim, and her face fell.  ""He will succeed for all

that.""



""He can levy taxes, of course.""



""But he will not-for himself.""



""I will give him twenty thousand pounds, if he will take it.""



""You--you!--will give him--"" Her eyes swam with pleasure.  ""Ah, that is

noble!  That makes wealth a glory, to give it to those who need it.  To

save those who are down-trodden, to help those who labour for the good of

the world, to--"" she stopped short, for all at once she remembered-

remembered whence his money came.  Her face suffused.  She turned to the

door.  Confusion overmastered her for the moment.  Then, anger at herself

possessed her.  On what enterprise was she now embarked?  Where was her

conscience?  For what was she doing all this?  What was the true meaning

of her actions?  Had it been to circumvent the Khedive?  To prevent him

from doing an unjust, a despicable, and a dreadful thing?  Was it only to

help the Soudan?  Was it but to serve a high ideal, through an ideal

life--through Gordon?



It came upon her with embarrassing force.  For none of these things was

she striving.  She was doing all for this man, against whose influence

she had laboured, whom she had bitterly condemned, and whose fortune she

had called blood-money and worse.  And now...



She knew the truth, and it filled her heart with joy and also pain.  Then

she caught at a straw: he was no slave-driver now.  He had--



""May I not help you--go with you to England?"" he questioned over her

shoulder.



""Like Alexander Selkirk 'I shall finish my journey alone,'"" she said,

with sudden but imperfectly assumed acerbity.



""Will you not help me, then?"" he asked.  ""We could write a book

together.""



""Oh, a book!"" she said.



""A book of life,"" he whispered.



""No, no, no--can't you see?--oh, you are playing me like a ball!""



""Only to catch you,"" he said, in a happier tone.



""To jest, when I am so unhappy!"" she murmured.



""My jest is the true word.""



She made a last rally.  ""Your fortune was made out of slave labour.""



""I have given up the slaves.""



""You have the fortune.""



""I will give it all to you--to have your will with it.  Now it is won,

I would give it up and a hundred times as much to hear you say, 'Come to

Skaw Fell again.""'



Did he really mean it?  She thought he did.  And it seemed the only way

out of the difficulty.  It broke the impasse.



It was not necessary, however, to spend the future in the way first

suggested to her mind.  They discussed all that at Skaw Fell months

later.



Human nature is weak and she has become a slavedriver, after all.

But he is her only slave, and he hugs his bondage.

_The Romantics used to say that the eyes were the windows of the Soul.

A good Alien Xenologist might not put it quite so poetically ... but he

can, if he’s sharp, read a lot in the look of an eye!_



Illustrated by van Dongen







“We ought to scrape this planet clean of every living thing on it,”

muttered Umbo Stetson, section chief of Investigation & Adjustment.



Stetson paced the landing control bridge of his scout cruiser. His

footsteps grated on a floor that was the rear wall of the bridge during

flight. But now the ship rested on its tail fins—all four hundred

glistening red and black meters of it. The open ports of the bridge

looked out on the jungle roof of Gienah III some one hundred fifty

meters below. A butter yellow sun hung above the horizon, perhaps an

hour from setting.



“Clean as an egg!” he barked. He paused in his round of the bridge,

glared out the starboard port, spat into the fire-blackened circle that

the cruiser’s jets had burned from the jungle.



The I-A section chief was dark-haired, gangling, with large head and big

features. He stood in his customary slouch, a stance not improved by

sacklike patched blue fatigues. Although on this present operation he

rated the flag of a division admiral, his fatigues carried no insignia.

There was a general unkempt, straggling look about him.



Lewis Orne, junior I-A field man with a maiden diploma, stood at the

opposite port, studying the jungle horizon. Now and then he glanced at

the bridge control console, the chronometer above it, the big translite

map of their position tilted from the opposite bulkhead. A heavy planet

native, he felt vaguely uneasy on this Gienah III with its gravity of

only seven-eighths Terran Standard. The surgical scars on his neck where

the micro-communications equipment had been inserted itched maddeningly.

He scratched.



“Hah!” said Stetson. “Politicians!”



A thin black insect with shell-like wings flew in Orne’s port, settled

in his close-cropped red hair. Orne pulled the insect gently from his

hair, released it. Again it tried to land in his hair. He ducked. It

flew across the bridge, out the port beside Stetson.



There was a thick-muscled, no-fat look to Orne, but something about his

blocky, off-center features suggested a clown.



“I’m getting tired of waiting,” he said.



“_You’re_ tired! Hah!”



A breeze rippled the tops of the green ocean below them. Here and there,

red and purple flowers jutted from the verdure, bending and nodding like

an attentive audience.



“Just look at that blasted jungle!” barked Stetson. “Them and their

stupid orders!”



A call bell tinkled on the bridge control console. The red light above

the speaker grid began blinking. Stetson shot an angry glance at it.

“Yeah, Hal?”



“O.K., Stet. Orders just came through. We use Plan C. ComGO says to

brief the field man, and jet out of here.”



“Did you ask them about using another field man?”



Orne looked up attentively.



The speaker said: “Yes. They said we have to use Orne because of the

records on the _Delphinus_.”



“Well then, will they give us more time to brief him?”



“Negative. It’s crash priority. ComGO expects to blast the planet

anyway.”



Stetson glared at the grid. “Those fat-headed, lard-bottomed,

pig-brained ... POLITICIANS!” He took two deep breaths, subsided. “O.K.

Tell them we’ll comply.”



“One more thing, Stet.”



“What now?”



“I’ve got a confirmed contact.”



Instantly, Stetson was poised on the balls of his feet, alert. “Where?”



“About ten kilometers out. Section AAB-6.”



“How many?”



“A mob. You want I should count them?”



“No. What’re they doing?”



“Making a beeline for us. You better get a move on.”



“O.K. Keep us posted.”



“Right.”



       *       *       *       *       *



Stetson looked across at his junior field man. “Orne, if you decide you

want out of this assignment, you just say the word. I’ll back you to the

hilt.”



“Why should I want out of my first field assignment?”



“Listen, and find out.” Stetson crossed to a tilt-locker behind the big

translite map, hauled out a white coverall uniform with gold insignia,

tossed it to Orne. “Get into these while I brief you on the map.”



“But this is an R&R uni—” began Orne.



“Get that uniform on your ugly frame!”



“Yes, sir, Admiral Stetson, sir. Right away, sir. But I thought I was

through with old Rediscovery & Reeducation when you drafted me off of

Hamal into the I-A ... sir.” He began changing from the I-A blue to the

R&R white. Almost as an afterthought, he said: “... Sir.”



A wolfish grin cracked Stetson’s big features. “I’m soooooo happy you

have the proper attitude of subservience toward authority.”



Orne zipped up the coverall uniform. “Oh, yes, sir ... sir.”



“O.K., Orne, pay attention.” Stetson gestured at the map with its green

superimposed grid squares. “Here we are. Here’s that city we flew over

on our way down. You’ll head for it as soon as we drop you. The place is

big enough that if you hold a course roughly northeast you can’t miss

it. We’re—”



Again the call bell rang.



“What is it this time, Hal?” barked Stetson.



“They’ve changed to Plan H, Stet. New orders cut.”



“Five days?”



“That’s all they can give us. ComGO says he can’t keep the information

out of High Commissioner Bullone’s hands any longer than that.”



“It’s five days for sure then.”



“Is this the usual R&R foul-up?” asked Orne.



Stetson nodded. “Thanks to Bullone and company! We’re just one jump

ahead of catastrophe, but they still pump the bushwah into the Rah & Rah

boys back at dear old Uni-Galacta!”



“You’re making light of my revered alma mater,” said Orne. He struck a

pose. “We must reunite the lost planets with our centers of culture and

industry, and take up the _glor_-ious onward march of mankind that was

so _bru_-tally—”



“Can it!” snapped Stetson. “We both know we’re going to rediscover one

planet too many some day. Rim War all over again. But this is a

different breed of fish. It’s not, repeat, _not_ a _re_-discovery.”



Orne sobered. “Alien?”



“Yes. A-L-I-E-N! A never-before-contacted culture. That language you

were force fed on the way over, that’s an alien language. It’s not

complete ... all we have off the _minis_. And we excluded data on the

natives because we’ve been hoping to dump this project and nobody the

wiser.”



“Holy mazoo!”



“Twenty-six days ago an I-A search ship came through here, had a routine

mini-sneaker look at the place. When he combed in his net of sneakers to

check the tapes and films, lo and behold, he had a little stranger.”



“One of _theirs_?”



“No. It was a _mini_ off the _Delphinus Rediscovery_. The _Delphinus_

has been unreported for eighteen standard months!”



“Did it crack up here?”



“We don’t know. If it did, we haven’t been able to spot it. She was

supposed to be way off in the Balandine System by now. But we’ve

something else on our minds. It’s the one item that makes me want to

blot out this place, and run home with my tail between my legs. We’ve

a—”



Again the call bell chimed.



“NOW WHAT?” roared Stetson into the speaker.



“I’ve got a _mini_ over that mob, Stet. They’re talking about us. It’s a

definite raiding party.”



“What armament?”



“Too gloomy in that jungle to be sure. The infra beam’s out on this

_mini_. Looks like hard pellet rifles of some kind. Might even be off

the _Delphinus_.”



“Can’t you get closer?”



“Wouldn’t do any good. No light down there, and they’re moving up fast.”



“Keep an eye on them, but don’t ignore the other sectors,” said Stetson.



“You think I was born yesterday?” barked the voice from the grid. The

contact broke off with an angry sound.



       *       *       *       *       *



“One thing I like about the I-A,” said Stetson. “It collects such

even-tempered types.” He looked at the white uniform on Orne, wiped a

hand across his mouth as though he’d tasted something dirty.



“Why _am_ I wearing this thing?” asked Orne.



“Disguise.”



“But there’s no mustache!”



Stetson smiled without humor. “That’s one of I-A’s answers to those

fat-keistered politicians. We’re setting up our own search system to

find the planets before _they_ do. We’ve managed to put spies in key

places at R&R. Any touchy planets our spies report, we divert the

files.”



“Then what?”



“Then we look into them with bright boys like you—disguised as R&R

field men.”



“Goody, goody. And what happens if R&R stumbles onto me while I’m down

there playing patty cake?”



“We disown you.”



“But you said an I-A ship found this joint.”



“It did. And then one of our spies in R&R intercepted a _routine_

request for an agent-instructor to be assigned here with full equipment.

Request signed by a First-Contact officer name of Diston ... of the

_Delphinus_!”



“But the Del—”



“Yeah. Missing. The request was a forgery. Now you see why I’m mostly

for rubbing out this place. Who’d dare forge such a thing unless he knew

for sure that the original FC officer was missing ... or dead?”



“What the jumped up mazoo are we doing here, Stet?” asked Orne. “Alien

calls for a full contact team with all of the—”



“It calls for one planet-buster bomb ... buster—in five days. Unless

you give them a white bill in the meantime. High Commissioner Bullone

will have word of this planet by then. If Gienah III still exists in

five days, can’t you imagine the fun the politicians’ll have with it?

Mama mia! We want this planet cleared for contact or dead before then.”



“I don’t like this, Stet.”



“YOU don’t like it!”



“Look,” said Orne. “There must be another way. Why ... when we teamed up

with the Alerinoids we gained five hundred years in the physical

sciences alone, not to mention the—”



“The Alerinoids didn’t knock over one of our survey ships first.”



“What if the _Delphinus_ just crashed here ... and the locals picked up

the pieces?”



“That’s what you’re going in to find out, Orne. But answer me this: If

they _do_ have the _Delphinus_, how long before a tool-using race could

be a threat to the galaxy?”



“I saw that city they built, Stet. They could be dug in within six

months, and there’d be no—”



“Yeah.”



Orne shook his head. “But think of it: Two civilizations that matured

along different lines! Think of all the different ways we’d approach the

same problems ... the lever that’d give us for—”



“You sound like a Uni-Galacta lecture! Are you through marching arm in

arm into the misty future?”



Orne took a deep breath. “Why’s a freshman like me being tossed into

this dish?”



“You’d still be on the _Delphinus_ master lists as an R&R field man.

That’s important if you’re masquerading.”



“Am I the only one? I know I’m a recent _convert_, but—”



“You want out?”



“I didn’t say that. I just want to know why I’m—”



“Because the bigdomes fed a set of requirements into one of their iron

monsters. Your card popped out. They were looking for somebody capable,

dependable ... and ... _expendable_!”



“Hey!”



“That’s why I’m down here briefing you instead of sitting back on a

flagship. _I_ got you into the I-A. Now, you listen carefully: If you

push the panic button on this one without cause, I will personally flay

you alive. We both know the advantages of an alien contact. But if you

get into a hot spot, and call for help, I’ll dive this cruiser into that

city to get you out!”



Orne swallowed. “Thanks, Stet. I’m—”



       *       *       *       *       *



“We’re going to take up a tight orbit. Out beyond us will be five

transports full of I-A marines and a Class IX Monitor with one

planet-buster. You’re calling the shots, God help you! First, we want to

know if they have the _Delphinus_ ... and if so, where it is. Next, we

want to know just how warlike these goons are. Can we control them if

they’re bloodthirsty. What’s their potential?”



“In five days?”



“Not a second more.”



“What do we know about them?”



“Not much. They look something like an ancient Terran chimpanzee ...

only with blue fur. Face is hairless, pink-skinned.” Stetson snapped a

switch. The translite map became a screen with a figure frozen on it.

“Like that. This is life size.”



“Looks like the missing link they’re always hunting for,” said Orne.

“Yeah, but you’ve got a different kind of a missing link.”



“Vertical-slit pupils in their eyes,” said Orne. He studied the figure.

It had been caught from the front by a mini-sneaker camera. About five

feet tall. The stance was slightly bent forward, long arms. Two vertical

nose slits. A flat, lipless mouth. Receding chin. Four-fingered hands.

It wore a wide belt from which dangled neat pouches and what looked like

tools, although their use was obscure. There appeared to be the tip of a

tail protruding from behind one of the squat legs. Behind the creature

towered the faery spires of the city they’d observed from the air.



“Tails?” asked Orne.



“Yeah. They’re arboreal. Not a road on the whole planet that we can

find. But there are lots of vine lanes through the jungles.” Stetson’s

face hardened. “Match _that_ with a city as advanced as that one.”



“Slave culture?”



“Probably.”



“How many cities have they?”



“We’ve found two. This one and another on the other side of the planet.

But the other one’s a ruin.”



“A ruin? Why?”



“You tell us. Lots of mysteries here.”



“What’s the planet like?”



“Mostly jungle. There are polar oceans, lakes and rivers. One low

mountain chain follows the equatorial belt about two thirds around the

planet.”



“But only two cities. Are you sure?”



“Reasonably so. It’d be pretty hard to miss something the size of that

thing we flew over. It must be fifty kilometers long and at least ten

wide. Swarming with these creatures, too. We’ve got a zone-count

estimate that places the city’s population at over thirty million.”



“Whee-ew! Those are tall buildings, too.”



“We don’t know much about this place, Orne. And unless you bring them

into the fold, there’ll be nothing but ashes for our archaeologists to

pick over.”



“Seems a dirty shame.”



“I agree, but—”



The call bell jangled.



       *       *       *       *       *



Stetson’s voice sounded tired: “Yeah, Hal?”



“That mob’s only about five kilometers out, Stet. We’ve got Orne’s gear

outside in the disguised air sled.”



“We’ll be right down.”



“Why a disguised sled?” asked Orne.



“If they think it’s a ground buggy, they might get careless when you

most need an advantage. We could always scoop you out of the air, you

know.”



“What’re my chances on this one, Stet?”



Stetson shrugged. “I’m afraid they’re slim. These goons probably have

the _Delphinus_, and they want you just long enough to get your

equipment and everything you know.”



“Rough as that, eh?”



“According to our best guess. If you’re not out in five days, we blast.”



Orne cleared his throat.



“Want out?” asked Stetson.



“No.”



“Use the _back-door_ rule, son. Always leave yourself a way out. Now ...

let’s check that equipment the surgeons put in your neck.” Stetson put a

hand to his throat. His mouth remained closed, but there was a

surf-hissing voice in Orne’s ears: “You read me?”



“Sure. I can—”



“No!” hissed the voice. “Touch the mike contact. Keep your mouth closed.

Just use your speaking muscles without speaking.”



Orne obeyed.



“O.K.,” said Stetson. “You come in loud and clear.”



“I ought to. I’m right on top of you!”



“There’ll be a relay ship over you all the time,” said Stetson. “Now ...

when you’re not touching that mike contact this rig’ll still feed us

what you say ... and everything that goes on around you, too. We’ll

monitor everything. Got that?”



“Yes.”



Stetson held out his right hand. “Good luck. I meant that about diving

in for you. Just say the word.”



“I know the word, too,” said Orne. “HELP!”



       *       *       *       *       *



Gray mud floor and gloomy aisles between monstrous bluish tree

trunks—that was the jungle. Only the barest weak glimmering of sunlight

penetrated to the mud. The disguised sled—its para-grav units turned

off—lurched and skidded around buttress roots. Its headlights swung in

wild arcs across the trunks and down to the mud. Aerial creepers—great

looping vines of them—swung down from the towering forest ceiling. A

steady drip of condensation spattered the windshield, forcing Orne to

use the wipers.



In the bucket seat of the sled’s cab, Orne fought the controls. He was

plagued by the vague slow-motion-floating sensation that a heavy planet

native always feels in lighter gravity. It gave him an unhappy stomach.



Things skipped through the air around the lurching vehicle: flitting and

darting things. Insects came in twin cones, siphoned toward the

headlights. There was an endless chittering whistling tok-tok-toking in

the gloom beyond the lights.



Stetson’s voice hissed suddenly through the surgically implanted

speaker: “How’s it look?”



“Alien.”



“Any sign of that mob?”



“Negative.”



“O.K. We’re taking off.”



Behind Orne, there came a deep rumbling roar that receded as the scout

cruiser climbed its jets. All other sounds hung suspended in

after-silence, then resumed: the strongest first and then the weakest.



A heavy object suddenly arced through the headlights, swinging on a

vine. It disappeared behind a tree. Another. Another. Ghostly shadows

with vine pendulums on both sides. Something banged down heavily onto

the hood of the sled.



[Illustration]



Orne braked to a creaking stop that shifted the load behind him, found

himself staring through the windshield at a native of Gienah III. The

native crouched on the hood, a Mark XX exploding-pellet rifle in his

right hand directed at Orne’s head. In the abrupt shock of meeting, Orne

recognized the weapon: standard issue to the marine guards on all R&R

survey ships.



The native appeared the twin of the one Orne had seen on the translite

screen. The four-fingered hand looked extremely capable around the stock

of the Mark XX.



Slowly, Orne put a hand to his throat, pressed the contact button. He

moved his speaking muscles: _“Just made contact with the mob. One on the

hood now has one of our Mark XX rifles aimed at my head.”_



The surf-hissing of Stetson’s voice came through the hidden speaker:

_“Want us to come back?”_



_“Negative. Stand by. He looks cautious rather than hostile.”_



Orne held up his right hand, palm out. He had a second thought: held up

his left hand, too. Universal symbol of peaceful intentions: empty

hands. The gun muzzle lowered slightly. Orne called into his mind the

language that had been hypnoforced into him. _Ocheero? No. That means

‘The People.’ Ah ..._ And he had the heavy fricative greeting sound.



“Ffroiragrazzi,” he said.



The native shifted to the left, answered in pure, unaccented High

Galactese: “Who are you?”



Orne fought down a sudden panic. The lipless mouth had looked so odd

forming the familiar words.



Stetson’s voice hissed: _“Is that the native speaking Galactese?”_



Orne touched his throat. _“You heard him.”_



He dropped his hand, said: “I am Lewis Orne of Rediscovery and

Reeducation. I was sent here at the request of the First-Contact officer

on the _Delphinus Rediscovery_.”



“Where is your ship?” demanded the Gienahn.



“It put me down and left.”



“Why?”



“It was behind schedule for another appointment.”



       *       *       *       *       *



Out of the corners of his eyes, Orne saw more shadows dropping to the

mud around him. The sled shifted as someone climbed onto the load behind

the cab. The someone scuttled agilely for a moment.



The native climbed down to the cab’s side step, opened the door. The

rifle was held at the ready. Again, the lipless mouth formed Galactese

words: “What do you carry in this ... vehicle?”



“The equipment every R&R field man uses to help the people of a

rediscovered planet improve themselves.” Orne nodded at the rifle.

“Would you mind pointing that weapon some other direction? It makes me

nervous.”



The gun muzzle remained unwaveringly on Orne’s middle. The native’s

mouth opened, revealing long canines. “Do we not look strange to you?”



“I take it there’s been a heavy mutational variation in the humanoid

norm on this planet,” said Orne. “What is it? Hard radiation?”



No answer.



“It doesn’t really make any difference, of course,” said Orne. “I’m here

to help you.”



“I am Tanub, High Path Chief of the Grazzi,” said the native. “I decide

who is to help.”



Orne swallowed.



“Where do you go?” demanded Tanub.



“I was hoping to go to your city. Is it permitted?”



A long pause while the vertical-slit pupils of Tanub’s eyes expanded and

contracted. “It is permitted.”



Stetson’s voice came through the hidden speaker: _“All bets off. We’re

coming in after you. That Mark XX is the final straw. It means they have

the_ Delphinus _for sure!”_



Orne touched his throat. _“No! Give me a little more time!”_



_“Why?”_



_“I have a hunch about these creatures.”_



_“What is it?”_



_“No time now. Trust me.”_



Another long pause in which Orne and Tanub continued to study each

other. Presently, Stetson said: _“O.K. Go ahead as planned. But find out

where the_ Delphinus _is! If we get that back we pull their teeth.”_



“Why do you keep touching your throat?” demanded Tanub.



“I’m nervous,” said Orne. “Guns always make me nervous.”



The muzzle lowered slightly.



“Shall we continue on to your city?” asked Orne. He wet his lips with

his tongue. The cab light on Tanub’s face was giving the Gienahn an

eerie sinister look.



“We can go soon,” said Tanub.



“Will you join me inside here?” asked Orne. “There’s a passenger seat

right behind me.”



Tanub’s eyes moved catlike: right, left. “Yes.” He turned, barked an

order into the jungle gloom, then climbed in behind Orne.



“When do we go?” asked Orne.



“The great sun will be down soon,” said Tanub. “We can continue as soon

as Chiranachuruso rises.”



“Chiranachuruso?”



“Our satellite ... our moon,” said Tanub.



“It’s a beautiful word,” said Orne. “Chiranachuruso.”



“In our tongue it means: The Limb of Victory,” said Tanub. “By its light

we will continue.”



Orne turned, looked back at Tanub. “Do you mean to tell me that you can

see by what light gets down here through those trees?”



“Can you not see?” asked Tanub.



“Not without the headlights.”



“Our eyes differ,” said Tanub. He bent toward Orne, peered. The vertical

slit pupils of his eyes expanded, contracted. “You are the same as the

... others.”



“Oh, on the _Delphinus_?”



Pause. “Yes.”



Presently, a greater gloom came over the jungle, bringing a sudden

stillness to the wild life. There was a chittering commotion from the

natives in the trees around the sled. Tanub shifted behind Orne.



“We may go now,” he said. “Slowly ... to stay behind my ... scouts.”



“Right.” Orne eased the sled forward around an obstructing root.



       *       *       *       *       *



Silence while they crawled ahead. Around them shapes flung themselves

from vine to vine.



“I admired your city from the air,” said Orne. “It is very beautiful.”



“Yes,” said Tanub. “Why did you land so far from it?”



“We didn’t want to come down where we might destroy anything.”



“There is nothing to destroy in the jungle,” said Tanub.



“Why do you have such a big city?” asked Orne.



Silence.



“I said: Why do you—”



“You are ignorant of our ways,” said Tanub. “Therefore, I forgive you.

The city is for our race. We must breed and be born in sunlight.

Once—long ago—we used crude platforms on the tops of the trees. Now

... only the ... wild ones do this.”



Stetson’s voice hissed in Orne’s ears: _“Easy on the sex line, boy.

That’s always touchy. These creatures are oviparous. Sex glands are

apparently hidden in that long fur behind where their chins ought to

be.”_



“Who controls the breeding sites controls our world,” said Tanub. “Once

there was another city. We destroyed it.”



“Are there many ... wild ones?” asked Orne.



“Fewer each year,” said Tanub.



_“There’s how they get their slaves,”_ hissed Stetson.



“You speak excellent Galactese,” said Orne.



“The High Path Chief commanded the best teacher,” said Tanub. “Do you,

too, know many things, Orne?”



“That’s why I was sent here,” said Orne.



“Are there many planets to teach?” asked Tanub.



“Very many,” said Orne. “Your city—I saw very tall buildings. Of what

do you build them?”



“In your tongue—glass,” said Tanub. “The engineers of the _Delphinus_

said it was impossible. As you saw—they are wrong.”



_“A glass-blowing culture,”_ hissed Stetson. _“That’d explain a lot of

things.”_



Slowly, the disguised sled crept through the jungle. Once, a scout

swooped down into the headlights, waved. Orne stopped on Tanub’s order,

and they waited almost ten minutes before proceeding.



“Wild ones?” asked Orne.



“Perhaps,” said Tanub.



A glowing of many lights grew visible through the giant tree trunks. It

grew brighter as the sled crept through the last of the jungle, emerged

in cleared land at the edge of the city.



Orne stared upward in awe. The city fluted and spiraled into the moonlit

sky. It was a fragile appearing lacery of bridges, winking dots of

light. The bridges wove back and forth from building to building until

the entire visible network appeared one gigantic dew-glittering web.



“All that with glass,” murmured Orne.



_“What’s happening?”_ hissed Stetson.



Orne touched his throat contact. _“We’re just into the city clearing,

proceeding toward the nearest building.”_



“This is far enough,” said Tanub.



       *       *       *       *       *



Orne stopped the sled. In the moonlight, he could see armed Gienahns all

around. The buttressed pedestal of one of the buildings loomed directly

ahead. It looked taller than had the scout cruiser in its jungle landing

circle.



Tanub leaned close to Orne’s shoulder. “We have not deceived you, have

we, Orne?”



“Huh? What do you mean?”



“You have recognized that we are not mutated members of your race.”



Orne swallowed. Into his ears came Stetson’s voice: _“Better admit it.”_



“That’s true,” said Orne.



“I like you, Orne,” said Tanub. “You shall be one of my slaves. You will

teach me many things.”



“How did you capture the _Delphinus_?” asked Orne.



“You know that, too?”



“You have one of their rifles,” said Orne.



“Your race is no match for us, Orne ... in cunning, in strength, in the

prowess of the mind. Your ship landed to repair its tubes. Very inferior

ceramics in those tubes.”



Orne turned, looked at Tanub in the dim glow of the cab light. “Have you

heard about the I-A, Tanub?”



“I-A? What is that?” There was a wary tenseness in the Gienahn’s figure.

His mouth opened to reveal the long canines.



“You took the _Delphinus_ by treachery?” asked Orne.



“They were simple fools,” said Tanub. “We are smaller, thus they thought

us weaker.” The Mark XX’s muzzle came around to center on Orne’s

stomach. “You have not answered my question. What is the I-A?”



“I am of the I-A,” said Orne. “Where’ve you hidden the _Delphinus_?”



“In the place that suits us best,” said Tanub. “In all our history there

has never been a better place.”



“What do you plan to do with it?” asked Orne.



“Within a year we will have a copy with our own improvements. After

that—”



“You intend to start a war?” asked Orne.



“In the jungle the strong slay the weak until only the strong remain,”

said Tanub.



“And then the strong prey upon each other?” asked Orne.



“That is a quibble for women,” said Tanub.



“It’s too bad you feel that way,” said Orne. “When two cultures meet

like this they tend to help each other. What have you done with the crew

of the _Delphinus_?”



“They are slaves,” said Tanub. “Those who still live. Some resisted.

Others objected to teaching us what we want to know.” He waved the gun

muzzle. “You will not be that foolish, will you, Orne?”



“No need to be,” said Orne. “I’ve another little lesson to teach you: I

already know where you’ve hidden the _Delphinus_.”



_“Go, boy!”_ hissed Stetson. _“Where is it?”_



“Impossible!” barked Tanub.



“It’s on your moon,” said Orne. “Darkside. It’s on a mountain on the

darkside of your moon.”



Tanub’s eyes dilated, contracted. “You read minds?”



“The I-A has no need to read minds,” said Orne. “We rely on superior

mental prowess.”



_“The marines are on their way,”_ hissed Stetson. _“We’re coming in to

get you. I’m going to want to know how you guessed that one.”_



“You are a weak fool like the others,” gritted Tanub.



“It’s too bad you formed your opinion of us by observing only the low

grades of the R&R,” said Orne.



_“Easy, boy,”_ hissed Stetson. _“Don’t pick a fight with him now.

Remember, his race is arboreal. He’s probably as strong as an ape.”_



“I could kill you where you sit!” grated Tanub.



“You write finish for your entire planet if you do,” said Orne. “I’m not

alone. There are others listening to every word we say. There’s a ship

overhead that could split open your planet with one bomb—wash it with

molten rock. It’d run like the glass you use for your buildings.”



“You are lying!”



“We’ll make you an offer,” said Orne. “We don’t really want to

exterminate you. We’ll give you limited membership in the Galactic

Federation until you prove you’re no menace to us.”



_“Keep talking,”_ hissed Stetson. _“Keep him interested.”_



“You dare insult me!” growled Tanub.



“You had better believe me,” said Orne. “We—”



Stetson’s voice interrupted him: _“Got it, Orne! They caught the_

Delphinus _on the ground right where you said it’d be! Blew the tubes

off it. Marines now mopping up.”_



“It’s like this,” said Orne. “We already have recaptured the

_Delphinus_.” Tanub’s eyes went instinctively skyward. “Except for the

captured armament you still hold, you obviously don’t have the weapons

to meet us,” continued Orne. “Otherwise, you wouldn’t be carrying that

rifle off the _Delphinus_.”



“If you speak the truth, then we shall die bravely,” said Tanub.



“No need for you to die,” said Orne.



“Better to die than be slaves,” said Tanub.



“We don’t need slaves,” said Orne. “We—”



“I cannot take the chance that you are lying,” said Tanub. “I must kill

you now.”



       *       *       *       *       *



Orne’s foot rested on the air sled control pedal. He depressed it.

Instantly, the sled shot skyward, heavy G’s pressing them down into the

seats. The gun in Tanub’s hands was slammed into his lap. He struggled

to raise it. To Orne, the weight was still only about twice that of his

home planet of Chargon. He reached over, took the rifle, found safety

belts, bound Tanub with them. Then he eased off the acceleration.



“We don’t need slaves,” said Orne. “We have machines to do our work.

We’ll send experts in here, teach you people how to exploit your planet,

how to build good transportation facilities, show you how to mine your

minerals, how to—”



“And what do we do in return?” whispered Tanub.



“You could start by teaching us how you make superior glass,” said Orne.

“I certainly hope you see things our way. We really don’t want to have

to come down there and clean you out. It’d be a shame to have to blast

that city into little pieces.”



Tanub wilted. Presently, he said: “Send me back. I will discuss this

with ... our council.” He stared at Orne. “You I-A’s are too strong. We

did not know.”



       *       *       *       *       *



In the wardroom of Stetson’s scout cruiser, the lights were low, the

leather chairs comfortable, the green beige table set with a decanter of

Hochar brandy and two glasses.



Orne lifted his glass, sipped the liquor, smacked his lips. “For a while

there, I thought I’d never be tasting anything like this again.”



Stetson took his own glass. “ComGO heard the whole thing over the

general monitor net,” he said. “D’you know you’ve been breveted to

senior field man?”



“Ah, they’ve already recognized my sterling worth,” said Orne.



The wolfish grin took over Stetson’s big features. “Senior field men

last about half as long as the juniors,” he said. “Mortality’s

terrific?”



“I might’ve known,” said Orne. He took another sip of the brandy.



Stetson flicked on the switch of a recorder beside him. “O.K. You can go

ahead any time.”



“Where do you want me to start?”



“First, how’d you spot right away where they’d hidden the _Delphinus_?”



“Easy. Tanub’s word for his people was _Grazzi_. Most races call

themselves something meaning _The People_. But in his tongue that’s

_Ocheero_. _Grazzi_ wasn’t on the translated list. I started working on

it. The most likely answer was that it had been adopted from another

language, and meant _enemy_.”



“And _that_ told you where the _Delphinus_ was?”



“No. But it fitted my hunch about these Gienahns. I’d kind of felt from

the first minute of meeting them that they had a culture like the

Indians of ancient Terra.”



“Why?”



“They came in like a primitive raiding party. The leader dropped right

onto the hood of my sled. An act of bravery, no less. Counting coup, you

see?”



“I guess so.”



“Then he said he was High Path Chief. That wasn’t on the language list,

either. But it was easy: _Raider Chief._ There’s a word in almost every

language in history that means raider and derives from a word for road,

path or highway.”



“Highwaymen,” said Stetson.



“Raid itself,” said Orne. “An ancient Terran language corruption of

road.”



“Yeah, yeah. But where’d all this translation griff put—”



“Don’t be impatient. Glass-blowing culture meant they were just out of

the primitive stage. That, we could control. Next, he said their moon

was _Chiranachuruso_, translated as _The Limb of Victory_. After that it

just fell into place.”



“How?”



“The vertical-slit pupils of their eyes. Doesn’t that mean anything to

you?”



“Maybe. What’s it mean to you?”



“Night-hunting predator accustomed to dropping upon its victims from

above. No other type of creature ever has had the vertical slit. And

Tanub said himself that the _Delphinus_ was hidden in the best place in

all of their history. History? That’d be a high place. Dark, likewise.

Ergo: a high place on the darkside of their moon.”



“I’m a pie-eyed greepus,” whispered Stetson.



Orne grinned, said: “You probably are ... sir.”

                No self-respecting artist can object to

                suffering for his art ... but not in a

             society where art is outdated by technology!





I



Halvorsen waited in the Chancery office while Monsignor Reedy disposed

of three persons who had preceded him. He was a little dizzy with

hunger and noticed only vaguely that the prelate's secretary was

beckoning to him. He started to his feet when the secretary pointedly

opened the door to Monsignor Reedy's inner office and stood waiting

beside it.



The artist crossed the floor, forgetting that he had leaned his

portfolio against his chair, remembered at the door and went back for

it, flushing. The secretary looked patient.



""Thanks,"" Halvorsen murmured to him as the door closed.



There was something wrong with the prelate's manner.



""I've brought the designs for the Stations, Padre,"" he said, opening

the portfolio on the desk.



""Bad news, Roald,"" said the monsignor. ""I know how you've been looking

forward to the commission--""



""Somebody else get it?"" asked the artist faintly, leaning against the

desk. ""I thought his eminence definitely decided I had the--""



""It's not that,"" said the monsignor. ""But the Sacred Congregation

of Rites this week made a pronouncement on images of devotion.

Stereopantograph is to be licit within a diocese at the discretion of

the bishop. And his eminence--""



""S.P.G.--slimy imitations,"" protested Halvorsen. ""Real as a plastic

eye. No texture. No guts. _You_ know that, Padre!"" he said accusingly.



""I'm sorry, Roald,"" said the monsignor. ""Your work is better than we'll

get from a stereopantograph--to my eyes, at least. But there are other

considerations.""



""Money!"" spat the artist.



""Yes, money,"" the prelate admitted. ""His eminence wants to see the St.

Xavier U. building program through before he dies. Is that a mortal

sin? And there are our schools, our charities, our Venus mission.

S.P.G. will mean a considerable saving on procurement and maintenance

of devotional images. Even if I could, I would not disagree with his

eminence on adopting it as a matter of diocesan policy.""



The prelate's eyes fell on the detailed drawings of the Stations of the

Cross and lingered.



""Your St. Veronica,"" he said abstractedly. ""Very fine. It suggests one

of Caravaggio's care-worn saints to me. I would have liked to see her

in the bronze.""



""So would I,"" said Halvorsen hoarsely. ""Keep the drawings, Padre."" He

started for the door.



""But I can't--""



""That's all right.""



The artist walked past the secretary blindly and out of the Chancery

into Fifth Avenue's spring sunlight. He hoped Monsignor Reedy was

enjoying the drawings and was ashamed of himself and sorry for

Halvorsen. And he was glad he didn't have to carry the heavy portfolio

any more. Everything seemed so heavy lately--chisels, hammer, wooden

palette. Maybe the padre would send him something and pretend it was

for expenses or an advance, as he had in the past.



Halvorsen's feet carried him up the Avenue. No, there wouldn't be

any advances any more. The last steady trickle of income had just

been dried up, by an announcement in _Osservatore Romano_. Religious

conservatism had carried the church as far as it would go in its

ancient role of art patron.



When all Europe was writing on the wonderful new vellum, the church

stuck to good old papyrus. When all Europe was writing on the wonderful

new paper, the church stuck to good old vellum. When all architects

and municipal monument committees and portrait bust clients were

patronizing the stereopantograph, the church stuck to good old

expensive sculpture. But not any more.



He was passing an S.P.G. salon now, where one of his Tuesday night

pupils worked: one of the few men in the classes. Mostly they consisted

of lazy, moody, irritable girls. Halvorsen, surprised at himself,

entered the salon, walking between asthenic semi-nude stereos executed

in transparent plastic that made the skin of his neck and shoulders

prickle with gooseflesh.



_Slime!_ he thought. _How can they--_



""May I help--oh, hello, Roald. What brings you here?""



He knew suddenly what had brought him there. ""Could you make a little

advance on next month's tuition, Lewis? I'm strapped."" He took a

nervous look around the chamber of horrors, avoiding the man's

condescending face.



""I guess so, Roald. Would ten dollars be any help? That'll carry us

through to the 25th, right?""



""Fine, right, sure,"" he said, while he was being unwillingly towed

around the place.



""I know you don't think much of S.P.G., but it's quiet now, so this is

a good chance to see how we work. I don't say it's Art with a capital

A, but you've got to admit it's _an_ art, something people like at a

price they can afford to pay. Here's where we sit them. Then you run

out the feelers to the reference points on the face. You know what they

are?""



He heard himself say dryly: ""I know what they are. The Egyptian

sculptors used them when they carved statues of the pharaohs.""



""Yes? I never knew that. There's nothing new under the Sun, is there?

But _this_ is the heart of the S.P.G."" The youngster proudly swung open

the door of an electronic device in the wall of the portrait booth.

Tubes winked sullenly at Halvorsen.



""The esthetikon?"" he asked indifferently. He did not feel indifferent,

but it would be absurd to show anger, no matter how much he felt

it, against a mindless aggregation of circuits that could calculate

layouts, criticize and correct pictures for a desired effect--and that

had put the artist of design out of a job.



""Yes. The lenses take sixteen profiles, you know, and we set the

esthetikon for whatever we want--cute, rugged, sexy, spiritual, brainy,

or a combination. It fairs curves from profile to profile to give us

just what we want, distorts the profiles themselves within limits if it

has to, and there's your portrait stored in the memory tank waiting to

be taped. You set your ratio for any enlargement or reduction you want

and play it back. I wish we were reproducing today; it's fascinating to

watch. You just pour in your cold-set plastic, the nozzles ooze out a

core and start crawling over to scan--a drop here, a worm there, and it

begins to take shape.



""We mostly do portrait busts here, the Avenue trade, but Wilgus,

the foreman, used to work in a monument shop in Brooklyn. He did

that heroic-size war memorial on the East River Drive--hired Garda

Bouchette, the TV girl, for the central figure. And what a figure!

He told me he set the esthetikon plates for three-quarter sexy,

one-quarter spiritual. Here's something interesting--standing figurine

of Orin Ryerson, the banker. He ordered twelve. Figurines are coming

in. The girls like them because they can show their shapes. You'd be

surprised at some of the poses they want to try--""



       *       *       *       *       *



Somehow, Halvorsen got out with the ten dollars, walked to Sixth Avenue

and sat down hard in a cheap restaurant. He had coffee and dozed a

little, waking with a guilty start at a racket across the street. There

was a building going up. For a while he watched the great machines pour

walls and floors, the workmen rolling here and there on their little

chariots to weld on a wall panel, stripe on an electric circuit of

conductive ink, or spray plastic finish over the ""wired"" wall, all

without leaving the saddles of their little mechanical chariots.



Halvorsen felt more determined. He bought a paper from a vending

machine by the restaurant door, drew another cup of coffee and turned

to the help-wanted ads.



The tricky trade-school ads urged him to learn construction work and

make big money. Be a plumbing-machine setup man. Be a house-wiring

machine tender. Be a servotruck driver. Be a lumber-stacker operator.

Learn pouring-machine maintenance.



_Make big money!_



A sort of panic overcame him. He ran to the phone booth and dialed a

Passaic number. He heard the _ring-ring-ring_ and strained to hear

old Mr. Krehbeil's stumping footsteps growing louder as he neared the

phone, even though he knew he would hear nothing until the receiver was

picked up.



       *       *       *       *       *



_Ring--ring--ring._ ""Hello?"" grunted the old man's voice, and his face

appeared on the little screen. ""Hello, Mr. Halvorsen. What can I do for

you?""



Halvorsen was tongue-tied. He couldn't possibly say: I just wanted to

see if you were still there. I was afraid you weren't there any more.

He choked and improvised: ""Hello, Mr. Krehbeil. It's about the banister

on the stairs in my place. I noticed it's pretty shaky. Could you come

over sometime and fix it for me?""



Krehbeil peered suspiciously out of the screen. ""I could do that,"" he

said slowly. ""I don't have much work nowadays. But you can carpenter

as good as me, Mr. Halvorsen, and frankly you're very slow pay and I

like cabinet work better. I'm not a young man and climbing around

on ladders takes it out of me. If you can't find anybody else, I'll

take the work, but I got to have some of the money first, just for the

materials. It isn't easy to get good wood any more.""



""All right,"" said Halvorsen. ""Thanks, Mr. Krehbeil. I'll call you if I

can't get anybody else.""



He hung up and went back to his table and newspaper. His face was

burning with anger at the old man's reluctance and his own foolish

panic. Krehbeil didn't realize they were both in the same leaky boat.

Krehbeil, who didn't get a job in a month, still thought with senile

pride that he was a journeyman carpenter and cabinetmaker who could

make his solid way anywhere with his tool-box and his skill, and

that he could afford to look down on anything as disreputable as an

artist--even an artist who could carpenter as well as he did himself.



Labuerre had made Halvorsen learn carpentry, and Labuerre had been

right. You build a scaffold so you can sculp up high, not so it will

collapse and you break a leg. You build your platforms so they hold

the rock steady, not so it wobbles and chatters at every blow of the

chisel. You build your armatures so they hold the plasticine you slam

onto them.



But the help-wanted ads wanted no builders of scaffolds, platforms and

armatures. The factories were calling for setup men and maintenance men

for the production and assembly machines.



From upstate, General Vegetables had sent a recruiting team for farm

help--harvest setup and maintenance men, a few openings for experienced

operators of tank-caulking machinery. Under ""office and professional""

the demand was heavy for computer men, for girls who could run the

I.B.M. Letteriter, esp. familiar sales and collections corresp., for

office machinery maintenance and repair men. A job printing house

wanted an esthetikon operator for letterhead layouts and the like. A.T.

& T. wanted trainees to earn while learning telephone maintenance. A

direct-mail advertising outfit wanted an artist--no, they wanted a

sales-executive who could scrawl picture-ideas that would be subjected

to the criticism and correction of the esthetikon.



Halvorsen leafed tiredly through the rest of the paper. He knew he

wouldn't get a job, and if he did he wouldn't hold it. He knew it was

a terrible thing to admit to yourself that you might starve to death

because you were bored by anything except art, but he admitted it.



It had happened often enough in the past--artists undergoing

preposterous hardships, not, as people thought, because they were

devoted to art, but because nothing else was interesting. If there

were only some impressive, sonorous word that summed up the aching,

oppressive futility that overcame him when he tried to get out of

art--only there wasn't.



He thought he could tell which of the photos in the tabloid had been

corrected by the esthetikon.



There was a shot of Jink Bitsy, who was to star in a remake of _Peter

Pan_. Her ears had been made to look not pointed but pointy, her upper

lip had been lengthened a trifle, her nose had been pugged a little and

tilted quite a lot, her freckles were cuter than cute, her brows were

innocently arched, and her lower lip and eyes were nothing less than

pornography.



There was a shot, apparently uncorrected, of the last Venus ship coming

in at La Guardia and the average-looking explorers grinning. Caption:

""Austin Malone and crew smile relief on safe arrival. Malone says Venus

colonies need men, machines. See story p. 2.""



Petulantly, Halvorsen threw the paper under the table and walked

out. What had space travel to do with him? Vacations on the Moon and

expeditions to Venus and Mars were part of the deadly encroachment on

his livelihood and no more.





II



He took the subway to Passaic and walked down a long-still traffic

beltway to his studio, almost the only building alive in the slums near

the rusting railroad freightyard.



A sign that had once said ""F. Labuerre, Sculptor--Portraits

and Architectural Commissions"" now said ""Roald Halvorsen; Art

Classes--Reasonable Fees."" It was a grimy two-story frame building with

a shopfront in which were mounted some of his students' charcoal figure

studies and oil still-lifes. He lived upstairs, taught downstairs

front, and did his own work downstairs, back behind dirty, ceiling-high

drapes.



Going in, he noticed that he had forgotten to lock the door again. He

slammed it bitterly. At the noise, somebody called from behind the

drapes: ""Who's that?""



""Halvorsen!"" he yelled in a sudden fury. ""I live here. I own this

place. Come out of there! What do you want?""



There was a fumbling at the drapes and a girl stepped between them,

shrinking from their dirt.



""Your door was open,"" she said firmly, ""and it's a shop. I've just

been here a couple of minutes. I came to ask about classes, but I don't

think I'm interested if you're this bad-tempered.""



A pupil. Pupils were never to be abused, especially not now.



""I'm terribly sorry,"" he said. ""I had a trying day in the city."" Now

turn it on. ""I wouldn't tell everybody a terrible secret like this, but

I've lost a commission. You understand? I thought so. Anybody who'd

traipse out here to my dingy abode would be _simpatica_. Won't you

sit down? No, not there--humor an artist and sit over there. The warm

background of that still-life brings out your color--quite good color.

Have you ever been painted? You've a very interesting face, you know.

Some day I'd like to--but you mentioned classes.



""We have figure classes, male and female models alternating, on Tuesday

nights. For that I have to be very stern and ask you to sign up for

an entire course of twelve lessons at sixty dollars. It's the models'

fees--they're exorbitant. Saturday afternoons we have still-life

classes for beginners in oils. That's only two dollars a class, but you

might sign up for a series of six and pay ten dollars in advance, which

saves you two whole dollars. I also give private instructions to a few

talented amateurs.""



The price was open on that one--whatever the traffic would bear. It had

been a year since he'd had a private pupil and she'd taken only six

lessons at five dollars an hour.



""The still-life sounds interesting,"" said the girl, holding her head

self-consciously the way they all did when he gave them the patter.

It was a good head, carried well up. The muscles clung close, not

yet slacked into geotropic loops and lumps. The line of youth is

heliotropic, he confusedly thought. ""I saw some interesting things back

there. Was that your own work?""



She rose, obviously with the expectation of being taken into the

studio. Her body was one of those long-lined, small-breasted, coltish

jobs that the pre-Raphaelites loved to draw.



""Well--"" said Halvorsen. A deliberate show of reluctance and then a

bright smile of confidence. ""_You'll_ understand,"" he said positively

and drew aside the curtains.



""What a curious place!"" She wandered about, inspecting the drums of

plaster, clay and plasticene, the racks of tools, the stands, the

stones, the chisels, the forge, the kiln, the lumber, the glaze bench.



""I _like_ this,"" she said determinedly, picking up a figure a

half-meter tall, a Venus he had cast in bronze while studying under

Labuerre some years ago. ""How much is it?""



An honest answer would scare her off, and there was no chance in the

world that she'd buy. ""I hardly ever put my things up for sale,""

he told her lightly. ""That was just a little study. I do work on

commission only nowadays.""



Her eyes flicked about the dingy room, seeming to take in its scaling

plaster and warped floor and see through the wall to the abandoned slum

in which it was set. There was amusement in her glance.



_I am not being honest, she thinks. She thinks that is funny. Very

well, I will be honest._ ""Six hundred dollars,"" he said flatly.



       *       *       *       *       *



The girl set the figurine on its stand with a rap and said, half angry

and half amused: ""I don't understand it. That's more than a month's pay

for me. I could get an S.P.G. statuette just as pretty as this for ten

dollars. Who do you artists think you are, anyway?""



Halvorsen debated with himself about what he could say in reply:



_An S.P.G. operator spends a week learning his skill and I spend a

lifetime learning mine._



_An S.P.G. operator makes a mechanical copy of a human form distorted

by formulae mechanically arrived at from psychotests of population

samples. I take full responsibility for my work; it is mine, though

I use what I see fit from Egypt, Greece, Rome, the Middle Ages, the

Renaissance, the Augustan and Romantic and Modern Eras._



_An S.P.G. operator works in soft, homogeneous plastic; I work in

bronze that is more complicated than you dream, that is cast and

acid-dipped today so it will slowly take on rich and subtle coloring

many years from today._



_An S.P.G. operator could not make an Orpheus Fountain_--



He mumbled, ""Orpheus,"" and keeled over.



       *       *       *       *       *



Halvorsen awoke in his bed on the second floor of the building. His

fingers and toes buzzed electrically and he felt very clear-headed. The

girl and a man, unmistakably a doctor, were watching him.



""You don't seem to belong to any Medical Plans, Halvorsen,"" the doctor

said irritably. ""There weren't any cards on you at all. No Red, no

Blue, no Green, no Brown.""



""I used to be on the Green Plan, but I let it lapse,"" the artist said

defensively.



""And look what happened!""



""Stop nagging him!"" the girl said. ""I'll pay you your fee.""



""It's supposed to come through a Plan,"" the doctor fretted.



""We won't tell anybody,"" the girl promised. ""Here's five dollars. Just

stop nagging him.""



""Malnutrition,"" said the doctor. ""Normally I'd send him to a hospital,

but I don't see how I could manage it. He isn't on any Plan at all.

Look, I'll take the money and leave some vitamins. That's what he

needs--vitamins. And food.""



""I'll see that he eats,"" the girl said, and the doctor left.



""How long since you've had anything?"" she asked Halvorsen.



""I had some coffee today,"" he answered, thinking back. ""I'd been

working on detail drawings for a commission and it fell through. I told

you that. It was a shock.""



""I'm Lucretia Grumman,"" she said, and went out.



He dozed until she came back with an armful of groceries.



""It's hard to get around down here,"" she complained.



""It was Labuerre's studio,"" he told her defiantly. ""He left it to me

when he died. Things weren't so rundown in his time. I studied under

him; he was one of the last. He had a joke--'They don't really want my

stuff, but they're ashamed to let me starve.' He warned me that they

wouldn't be ashamed to let _me_ starve, but I insisted and he took me

in.""



Halvorsen drank some milk and ate some bread. He thought of the change

from the ten dollars in his pocket and decided not to mention it. Then

he remembered that the doctor had gone through his pockets.



""I can pay you for this,"" he said. ""It's very kind of you, but you

mustn't think I'm penniless. I've just been too preoccupied to take

care of myself.""



""Sure,"" said the girl. ""But we can call this an advance. I want to sign

up for some classes.""



""Be happy to have you.""



""Am I bothering you?"" asked the girl. ""You said something odd when you

fainted--'Orpheus.'""



""Did I say that? I must have been thinking of Milles' Orpheus Fountain

in Copenhagen. I've seen photos, but I've never been there.""



""Germany? But there's nothing left of Germany.""



""Copenhagen's in Denmark. There's quite a lot of Denmark left. It was

only on the fringes. Heavily radiated, but still there.""



""I want to travel, too,"" she said. ""I work at La Guardia and I've never

been off, except for an orbiting excursion. I want to go to the Moon

on my vacation. They give us a bonus in travel vouchers. It must be

wonderful dancing under the low gravity.""



Spaceport? Off? Low gravity? Terms belonging to the detested electronic

world of the stereopantograph in which he had no place.



""Be very interesting,"" he said, closing his eyes to conceal disgust.



""I _am_ bothering you. I'll go away now, but I'll be back Tuesday night

for the class. What time do I come and what should I bring?""



""Eight. It's charcoal--I sell you the sticks and paper. Just bring a

smock.""



""All right. And I want to take the oils class, too. And I want to bring

some people I know to see your work. I'm sure they'll see something

they like. Austin Malone's in from Venus--he's a special friend of

mine.""



""Lucretia,"" he said. ""Or do some people call you Lucy?""



""Lucy.""



""Will you take that little bronze you liked? As a thank you?""



""I can't do that!""



""Please. I'd feel much better about this. I really mean it.""



She nodded abruptly, flushing, and almost ran from the room.



_Now why did I do that?_ he asked himself. He hoped it was because

he liked Lucy Grumman very much. He hoped it wasn't a cold-blooded

investment of a piece of sculpture that would never be sold, anyway,

just to make sure she'd be back with class fees and more groceries.





III



She was back on Tuesday, a half-hour early and carrying a smock. He

introduced her formally to the others as they arrived: a dozen or so

bored young women who, he suspected, talked a great deal about their

art lessons outside, but in class used any excuse to stop sketching.



He didn't dare show Lucy any particular consideration. There were

fierce little miniature cliques in the class. Halvorsen knew they

laughed at him and his line among themselves, and yet, strangely, were

fiercely jealous of their seniority and right to individual attention.



The lesson was an ordeal, as usual. The model, a muscle-bound young

graduate of the barbell gyms and figure-photography studios, was stupid

and argumentative about ten-minute poses. Two of the girls came near a

hair-pulling brawl over the rights to a preferred sketching location. A

third girl had discovered Picasso's cubist period during the past week

and proudly announced that she didn't _feel_ perspective in art.



But the two interminable hours finally ticked by. He nagged them into

cleaning up--not as bad as the Saturdays with oils--and stood by the

open door. Otherwise they would have stayed all night, cackling about

absent students and snarling sulkily among themselves. His well-laid

plans went sour, though. A large and flashy car drove up as the girls

were leaving.



""That's Austin Malone,"" said Lucy. ""He came to pick me up and look at

your work.""



That was all the wedge her fellow-pupils needed.



""_Aus_-tin Ma-_lone_! _Well!_""



""Lucy, darling, I'd love to meet a real _spaceman_.""



""Roald, darling, would you mind very much if I stayed a moment?""



""I'm certainly not going to miss this and I don't care if you mind or

not, Roald, darling!""



Malone was an impressive figure. Halvorsen thought: he looks as though

he's been run through an esthetikon set for 'brawny' and 'determined.'

Lucy made a hash of the introductions and the spaceman didn't rise to

conversational bait dangled enticingly by the girls.



In a clear voice, he said to Halvorsen: ""I don't want to take up too

much of your time. Lucy tells me you have some things for sale. Is

there any place we can look at them where it's quiet?""



The students made sulky exits.



""Back here,"" said the artist.



The girl and Malone followed him through the curtains. The spaceman

made a slow circuit of the studio, seeming to repel questions.



He sat down at last and said: ""I don't know what to think, Halvorsen.

This place stuns me. Do you _know_ you're in the Dark Ages?""



_People who never have given a thought to Chartres and Mont St. Michel

usually call it the Dark Ages_, Halvorsen thought wryly. He asked,

""Technologically, you mean? No, not at all. My plaster's better, my

colors are better, my metal is better--tool metal, not casting metal,

that is.""



""I mean _hand_ work,"" said the spaceman. ""Actually working by _hand_.""



The artist shrugged. ""There have been crazes for the techniques of the

boiler works and the machine shop,"" he admitted. ""Some interesting

things were done, but they didn't stand up well. Is there anything here

that takes your eye?""



""I like those dolphins,"" said the spaceman, pointing to a perforated

terra-cotta relief on the wall. They had been commissioned by an

architect, then later refused for reasons of economy when the house

had run way over estimate. ""They'd look bully over the fireplace in my

town apartment. Like them, Lucy?""



""I think they're wonderful,"" said the girl.



Roald saw the spaceman go rigid with the effort not to turn and stare

at her. He loved her and he was jealous.



Roald told the story of the dolphins and said: ""The price that the

architect thought was too high was three hundred and sixty dollars.""



Malone grunted. ""Doesn't seem unreasonable--if you set a high store on

inspiration.""



""I don't know about inspiration,"" the artist said evenly. ""But I was

awake for two days and two nights shoveling coal and adjusting drafts

to fire that thing in my kiln.""



The spaceman looked contemptuous. ""I'll take it,"" he said. ""Be

something to talk about during those awkward pauses. Tell me,

Halvorsen, how's Lucy's work? Do you think she ought to stick with it?""



""Austin,"" objected the girl, ""don't be so blunt. How can he possibly

know after one day?""



""She can't draw yet,"" the artist said cautiously. ""It's all

coordination, you know--thousands of hours of practice, training your

eye and hand to work together until you can put a line on paper where

you want it. Lucy, if you're really interested in it, you'll learn to

draw well. I don't think any of the other students will. They're in it

because of boredom or snobbery, and they'll stop before they have their

eye-hand coordination.""



""I _am_ interested,"" she said firmly.



Malone's determined restraint broke. ""Damned right you are. In--"" He

recovered himself and demanded of Halvorsen: ""I understand your point

about coordination. But thousands of hours when you can buy a camera?

It's absurd.""



""I was talking about drawing, not art,"" replied Halvorsen. ""Drawing

is putting a line on paper where you want it, I said."" He took a deep

breath and hoped the great distinction wouldn't sound ludicrous and

trivial. ""So let's say that art is knowing how to put the line in the

right place.""



""Be practical. There isn't any art. Not any more. I get around quite a

bit and I never see anything but photos and S.P.G.s. A few heirlooms,

yes, but nobody's painting or carving any more.""



""There's some art, Malone. My students--a couple of them in the

still-life class--are quite good. There are more across the country.

Art for occupational therapy, or a hobby, or something to do with the

hands. There's trade in their work. They sell them to each other, they

give them to their friends, they hang them on their walls. There are

even some sculptors like that. Sculpture is prescribed by doctors. The

occupational therapists say it's even better than drawing and painting,

so some of these people work in plasticene and soft stone, and some of

them get to be good.""



""Maybe so. I'm an engineer, Halvorsen. We glory in doing things the

easy way. Doing things the easy way got me to Mars and Venus and it's

going to get me to Ganymede. You're doing things the hard way, and your

inefficiency has no place in this world. Look at you! You've lost a

fingertip--some accident, I suppose.""



""I never noticed--"" said Lucy, and then let out a faint, ""Oh!""



Halvorsen curled the middle finger of his left hand into the palm,

where he usually carried it to hide the missing first joint.



""Yes,"" he said softly. ""An accident.""



""Accidents are a sign of inadequate mastery of material and equipment,""

said Malone sententiously. ""While you stick to your methods and I stick

to mine, _you can't compete with me_.""



His tone made it clear that he was talking about more than engineering.



""Shall we go now, Lucy? Here's my card, Halvorsen. Send those dolphins

along and I'll mail you a check.""





IV



The artist walked the half-dozen blocks to Mr. Krehbeil's place the

next day. He found the old man in the basement shop of his fussy house,

hunched over his bench with a powerful light overhead. He was trying to

file a saw.



""Mr. Krehbeil!"" Halvorsen called over the shriek of metal.



The carpenter turned around and peered with watery eyes. ""I can't see

like I used to,"" he said querulously. ""I go over the same teeth on this

damn saw, I skip teeth, I can't see the light shine off it when I got

one set. The glare."" He banged down his three-cornered file petulantly.

""Well, what can I do for you?""



""I need some crating stock. Anything. I'll trade you a couple of my

maple four-by-fours.""



The old face became cunning. ""And will you set my saw? My _saws_, I

mean. It's nothing to you--an hour's work. You have the eyes.""



Halvorsen said bitterly, ""All right."" The old man had to drive his

bargain, even though he might never use his saws again. And then the

artist promptly repented of his bitterness, offering up a quick prayer

that his own failure to conform didn't make him as much of a nuisance

to the world as Krehbeil was.



The carpenter was pleased as they went through his small stock of wood

and chose boards to crate the dolphin relief. He was pleased enough to

give Halvorsen coffee and cake before the artist buckled down to filing

the saws.



Over the kitchen table, Halvorsen tried to probe. ""Things pretty slow

now?""



It would be hard to spoil Krehbeil's day now. ""People are always fools.

They don't know good hand work. Some day,"" he said apocalyptically, ""I

laugh on the other side of my face when their foolish machine-buildings

go falling down in a strong wind, all of them, all over the country.

Even my boy--I used to beat him good, almost every day--he works a

foolish concrete machine and his house should fall on his head like the

rest.""



Halvorsen knew it was Krehbeil's son who supported him by mail, and

changed the subject. ""You get some cabinet work?""



""Stupid women! What they call antiques--they don't know Meissen, they

don't know Biedermeier. They bring me trash to repair sometimes. I make

them pay; I swindle them good.""



""I wonder if things would be different if there were anything left over

in Europe....""



""People will still be fools, Mr. Halvorsen,"" said the carpenter

positively. ""Didn't you say you were going to file those saws today?""



So the artist spent two noisy hours filing before he carried his

crating stock to the studio.



       *       *       *       *       *



Lucy was there. She had brought some things to eat. He dumped the

lumber with a bang and demanded: ""Why aren't you at work?""



""We get days off,"" she said vaguely. ""Austin thought he'd give me the

cash for the terra-cotta and I could give it to you.""



She held out an envelope while he studied her silently. The farce was

beginning again. But this time he dreaded it.



It would not be the first time that a lonesome, discontented girl chose

to see him as a combination of romantic rebel and lost pup, with the

consequences you'd expect.



He knew from books, experience and Labuerre's conversation in the old

days that there was nothing novel about the comedy--that there had

even been artists, lots of them, who had counted on endless repetitions

of it for their livelihood.



The girl drops in with groceries and the artist is pleasantly

surprised; the girl admires this little thing or that after payday and

buys it and the artist is pleasantly surprised; the girl brings her

friends to take lessons or make little purchases and the artist is

pleasantly surprised. The girl may be seduced by the artist or vice

versa, which shortens the comedy, or they get married, which lengthens

it somewhat.



It had been three years since Halvorsen had last played out the farce

with a manic-depressive divorcee from Elmira: three years during which

he had crossed the mid-point between thirty and forty; three more years

to get beaten down by being unwanted and working too much and eating

too little.



Also, he knew, he was in love with this girl.



He took the envelope, counted three hundred and twenty dollars and

crammed it into his pocket. ""That was your idea,"" he said. ""Thanks. Now

get out, will you? I've got work to do.""



She stood there, shocked.



""_I said get out. I have work to do._""



""Austin was right,"" she told him miserably. ""You don't care how people

feel. You just want to get things out of them.""



She ran from the studio, and Halvorsen fought with himself not to run

after her.



He walked slowly into his workshop and studied his array of tools,

though he paid little attention to his finished pieces. It would be

nice to spend about half of this money on open-hearth steel rod and

bar stock to forge into chisels; he thought he knew where he could get

some--but she would be back, or he would break and go to her and be

forgiven and the comedy would be played out, after all.



He couldn't let that happen.





V



Aalesund, on the Atlantic side of the Dourefeld mountains of Norway,

was in the lee of the blasted continent. One more archeologist there

made no difference, as long as he had the sense to recognize the

propellor-like international signposts that said with their three

blades, _Radiation Hazard_, and knew what every schoolboy knew about

protective clothing and reading a personal Geiger counter.



The car Halvorsen rented was for a brief trip over the mountains to

study contaminated Oslo. Well-muffled, he could make it and back in a

dozen hours and no harm done.



But he took the car past Oslo, Wennersborg and Goteborg, along the

Kattegat coast to Helsingborg, and abandoned it there, among the

three-bladed polyglot signs, crossing to Denmark. Danes were as unlike

Prussians as they could be, but their unfortunate little peninsula was

a sprout off Prussia which radio-cobalt dust couldn't tell from the

real thing. The three-bladed signs were most specific.



With a long way to walk along the rubble-littered highways, he stripped

off the impregnated coveralls and boots. He had long since shed the

noisy counter and the uncomfortable gloves and mask.



The silence was eerie as he limped into Copenhagen at noon. He didn't

know whether the radiation was getting to him or whether he was tired

and hungry and no more. As though thinking of a stranger, he liked what

he was doing.



_I'll be my own audience, he thought. God knows I learned there isn't

any other, not any more. You have to know when to stop. Rodin, the

dirty old, wonderful old man, knew that. He taught us not to slick it

and polish it and smooth it until it looked like liquid instead of

bronze and stone. Van Gogh was crazy as a loon, but he knew when to

stop and varnish it, and he didn't care if the paint looked like paint

instead of looking like sunset clouds or moonbeams. Up in Hartford,

Browne and Sharpe stop when they've got a turret lathe; they don't put

caryatids on it. I'll stop while my life is a life, before it becomes

a thing with distracting embellishments such as a wife who will come

to despise me, a succession of gradually less worthwhile pieces that

nobody will look at._



_Blame nobody_, he told himself, lightheadedly.



And then it was in front of him, terminating a vista of weeds and bomb

rubble--Milles' Orpheus Fountain.



It took a man, he thought. Esthetikon circuits couldn't do it. There

was a gross mixture of styles, a calculated flaw that the esthetikon

couldn't be set to make. Orpheus and the souls were classic or later;

the three-headed dog was archaic. That was to tell you about the

antiquity and invincibility of Hell, and that Cerberus knows Orpheus

will never go back into life with his bride.



There was the heroic, tragic central figure that looked mighty enough

to battle with the gods, but battle wasn't any good against the

grinning, knowing, hateful three-headed dog it stood on. You don't

battle the pavement where you walk or the floor of the house you're in;

you can't. So Orpheus, his face a mask of controlled and suffering

fury crashes a great chord from his lyre that moved trees and stones.

Around him the naked souls in Hell start at the chord, each in its own

way: the young lovers down in death; the mother down in death; the

musician, deaf and down in death, straining to hear.



Halvorsen, walking uncertainly toward the fountain, felt something

break inside him, and a heaviness in his lungs. As he pitched forward

among the weeds, he thought he heard the chord from the lyre and didn't

care that the three-headed dog was grinning its knowing, hateful grin

down at him.





VI



When Halvorsen awoke, he supposed he was in Hell. There were the young

lovers, arms about each other's waists, solemnly looking down at him,

and the mother was placidly smoothing his brow. He stirred and felt his

left arm fall heavily.



""Ah,"" said the mother, ""you mustn't."" He felt her pick up his limp arm

and lay it across his chest. ""Your poor finger!"" she sighed. ""Can you

talk? What happened to it?""



He could talk, weakly. ""Labuerre and I,"" he said. ""We were moving a big

block of marble with the crane--somehow the finger got under it. I

didn't notice until it was too late to shift my grip without the marble

slipping and smashing on the floor.""



The boy said in a solemn, adolescent croak: ""You mean you saved the

marble and lost your finger?""



""Marble,"" he muttered. ""It's so hard to get. Labuerre was so old.""



The young lovers exchanged a glance and he slept again. He was half

awake when the musician seized first one of his hands and then the

other, jabbing them with stubby fingers and bending his lion's head

close to peer at the horny callouses left by chisel and mallet.



""_Ja, ja_,"" the musician kept saying.



Hell goes on forever, so for an eternity he jolted and jarred, and for

an eternity he heard bickering voices: ""Why he was so foolish, then?""

""A idiot he could be."" ""Hush, let him rest."" ""The children told the

story."" ""There only one Labuerre was."" ""Easy with the tubing."" ""Let him

rest.""



Daylight dazzled his eyes.



""Why you were so foolish?"" demanded a harsh voice. ""The sister says I

can talk to you now, so that is what I first want to know.""



He looked at the face of--not the musician; that had been delirium. But

it was a tough old face.



""_Ja_, I am mean-looking; that is settled. What did you think you were

doing without coveralls and way over your exposure time?""



""I wanted to die,"" said Halvorsen. There were tubes sticking in his

arms.



The crag-faced old man let out a contemptuous bellow.



""Sister!"" he shouted. ""Pull the plasma tubes out before more we waste.

He says he wants to die.""



""Hush,"" said the nurse. She laid her hand on his brow again.



""Don't bother with him, Sister,"" the old man jeered. ""He is a shrinking

little flower, too delicate for the great, rough world. He has done

nothing, he can do nothing, so he decides to make of himself a nuisance

by dying.""



""You lie,"" said Halvorsen. ""I worked. Good God, how I worked! Nobody

wanted my work. They wanted me, to wear in their buttonholes like a

flower. They were getting to me. Another year and I wouldn't have been

an artist any more.""



""_Ja?_"" asked the old man. ""Tell me about it.""



Halvorsen told him, sometimes weeping with self-pity and weakness,

sometimes cursing the old man for not letting him die, sometimes

quietly describing this statuette or that portrait head, or raving

wildly against the mad folly of the world.



At the last he told the old man about Lucy.



""You cannot have everything, you know,"" said his listener.



""I can have her,"" answered the artist harshly. ""You wouldn't let me

die, so I won't die. I'll go back and I'll take her away from that

fat-head Malone that she ought to marry. I'll give her a couple of

happy years working herself to skin and bones for me before she begins

to hate it--before I begin to hate it.""



""You can't go back,"" said the old man. ""I'm Cerberus. You understand

that? The girl is nothing. The society you come from is nothing. We

have a place here.... Sister, can he sit up?""



The woman smiled and cranked his bed. Halvorsen saw through a picture

window that he was in a mountain-rimmed valley that was very green and

dotted with herds and unpainted houses.



""Such a place there had to be,"" said the old man. ""In the whole

geography of Europe, there had to be a Soltau Valley with winds and

terrain just right to deflect the dust.""



""Nobody knows?"" whispered the artist.



""We prefer it that way. It's impossible to get some things, but you

would be surprised how little difference it makes to the young people.

They are great travelers, the young people, in their sweaty coveralls

with radiation meters. They think when they see the ruined cities that

the people who lived in them must have been mad. It was a little travel

party like that which found you. The boy was impressed by something you

said, and I saw some interesting things in your hands. There isn't much

rock around here; we have fine deep topsoil. But the boys could get you

stone.



""There should be a statue of the Mayor for one thing, before I die.

And from the Rathaus the wooden angels have mostly broken off. Soltau

Valley used to be proud of them--could you make good copies? And of

course cameras are useless and the best drawings we can do look funny.

Could you teach the youngers at least to draw so faces look like faces

and not behinds? And like you were saying about you and Labuerre, maybe

one younger there will be so crazy that he will want to learn it all,

so Soltau will always have an artist and sculptor for the necessary

work. And you will find a Lucy or somebody better. I think better.""



""Hush,"" warned the nurse. ""You're exciting the patient.""



""It's all right,"" said Halvorsen eagerly. ""Thanks, but it's really all

right.""

     THE INVALID'S STORY









HOW TO TELL A STORY



          The Humorous Story an American Development.--Its Difference

          from Comic and Witty Stories.



I do not claim that I can tell a story as it ought to be told. I only

claim to know how a story ought to be told, for I have been almost daily

in the company of the most expert story-tellers for many years.



There are several kinds of stories, but only one difficult kind--the

humorous. I will talk mainly about that one. The humorous story is

American, the comic story is English, the witty story is French. The

humorous story depends for its effect upon the manner of the telling;

the comic story and the witty story upon the matter.



The humorous story may be spun out to great length, and may wander

around as much as it pleases, and arrive nowhere in particular; but the

comic and witty stories must be brief and end with a point. The humorous

story bubbles gently along, the others burst.



The humorous story is strictly a work of art--high and delicate art--and

only an artist can tell it; but no art is necessary in telling the comic

and the witty story; anybody can do it. The art of telling a humorous

story--understand, I mean by word of mouth, not print--was created in

America, and has remained at home.



The humorous story is told gravely; the teller does his best to conceal

the fact that he even dimly suspects that there is anything funny about

it; but the teller of the comic story tells you beforehand that it is

one of the funniest things he has ever heard, then tells it with eager

delight, and is the first person to laugh when he gets through. And

sometimes, if he has had good success, he is so glad and happy that

he will repeat the “nub” of it and glance around from face to face,

collecting applause, and then repeat it again. It is a pathetic thing to

see.



Very often, of course, the rambling and disjointed humorous story

finishes with a nub, point, snapper, or whatever you like to call it.

Then the listener must be alert, for in many cases the teller will

divert attention from that nub by dropping it in a carefully casual and

indifferent way, with the pretence that he does not know it is a nub.



Artemus Ward used that trick a good deal; then when the belated audience

presently caught the joke he would look up with innocent surprise, as if

wondering what they had found to laugh at. Dan Setchell used it before

him, Nye and Riley and others use it to-day.



But the teller of the comic story does not slur the nub; he shouts it at

you--every time. And when he prints it, in England, France, Germany, and

Italy, he italicizes it, puts some whooping exclamation-points after

it, and sometimes explains it in a parenthesis. All of which is very

depressing, and makes one want to renounce joking and lead a better

life.



Let me set down an instance of the comic method, using an anecdote which

has been popular all over the world for twelve or fifteen hundred years.

The teller tells it in this way:









THE WOUNDED SOLDIER.



In the course of a certain battle a soldier whose leg had been shot

off appealed to another soldier who was hurrying by to carry him to the

rear, informing him at the same time of the loss which he had sustained;

whereupon the generous son of Mars, shouldering the unfortunate,

proceeded to carry out his desire. The bullets and cannon-balls were

flying in all directions, and presently one of the latter took the

wounded man's head off--without, however, his deliverer being aware of

it. In no-long time he was hailed by an officer, who said:



“Where are you going with that carcass?”



“To the rear, sir--he's lost his leg!”



“His leg, forsooth?” responded the astonished officer; “you mean his

head, you booby.”



Whereupon the soldier dispossessed himself of his burden, and stood

looking down upon it in great perplexity. At length he said:



“It is true, sir, just as you have said.” Then after a pause he added,

“But he TOLD me IT WAS HIS LEG--”





Here the narrator bursts into explosion after explosion of thunderous

horse-laughter, repeating that nub from time to time through his

gaspings and shriekings and suffocatings.



It takes only a minute and a half to tell that in its comic-story form;

and isn't worth the telling, after all. Put into the humorous-story

form it takes ten minutes, and is about the funniest thing I have ever

listened to--as James Whitcomb Riley tells it.



He tells it in the character of a dull-witted old farmer who has just

heard it for the first time, thinks it is unspeakably funny, and is

trying to repeat it to a neighbor. But he can't remember it; so he gets

all mixed up and wanders helplessly round and round, putting in tedious

details that don't belong in the tale and only retard it; taking them

out conscientiously and putting in others that are just as useless;

making minor mistakes now and then and stopping to correct them and

explain how he came to make them; remembering things which he forgot

to put in in their proper place and going back to put them in there;

stopping his narrative a good while in order to try to recall the name

of the soldier that was hurt, and finally remembering that the soldier's

name was not mentioned, and remarking placidly that the name is of no

real importance, anyway--better, of course, if one knew it, but not

essential, after all--and so on, and so on, and so on.



The teller is innocent and happy and pleased with himself, and has

to stop every little while to hold himself in and keep from laughing

outright; and does hold in, but his body quakes in a jelly-like way with

interior chuckles; and at the end of the ten minutes the audience have

laughed until they are exhausted, and the tears are running down their

faces.



The simplicity and innocence and sincerity and unconsciousness of the

old farmer are perfectly simulated, and the result is a performance

which is thoroughly charming and delicious. This is art and fine and

beautiful, and only a master can compass it; but a machine could tell

the other story.



To string incongruities and absurdities together in a wandering and

sometimes purposeless way, and seem innocently unaware that they

are absurdities, is the basis of the American art, if my position is

correct. Another feature is the slurring of the point. A third is the

dropping of a studied remark apparently without knowing it, as if one

were thinking aloud. The fourth and last is the pause.



Artemus Ward dealt in numbers three and four a good deal. He would begin

to tell with great animation something which he seemed to think was

wonderful; then lose confidence, and after an apparently absent-minded

pause add an incongruous remark in a soliloquizing way; and that was the

remark intended to explode the mine--and it did.



For instance, he would say eagerly, excitedly, “I once knew a man in New

Zealand who hadn't a tooth in his head”--here his animation would

die out; a silent, reflective pause would follow, then he would say

dreamily, and as if to himself, “and yet that man could beat a drum

better than any man I ever saw.”



The pause is an exceedingly important feature in any kind of story, and

a frequently recurring feature, too. It is a dainty thing, and delicate,

and also uncertain and treacherous; for it must be exactly the right

length--no more and no less--or it fails of its purpose and makes

trouble. If the pause is too short the impressive point is passed, and

[and if too long] the audience have had time to divine that a surprise

is intended--and then you can't surprise them, of course.



On the platform I used to tell a negro ghost story that had a pause in

front of the snapper on the end, and that pause was the most important

thing in the whole story. If I got it the right length precisely, I

could spring the finishing ejaculation with effect enough to make some

impressible girl deliver a startled little yelp and jump out of her

seat--and that was what I was after. This story was called “The

Golden Arm,” and was told in this fashion. You can practise with it

yourself--and mind you look out for the pause and get it right.









THE GOLDEN ARM.



Once 'pon a time dey wuz a monsus mean man, en he live 'way out in de

prairie all 'lone by hisself, 'cep'n he had a wife. En bimeby she died,

en he tuck en toted her way out dah in de prairie en buried her. Well,

she had a golden arm--all solid gold, fum de shoulder down. He wuz

pow'ful mean--pow'ful; en dat night he couldn't sleep, Gaze he want dat

golden arm so bad.



When it come midnight he couldn't stan' it no mo'; so he git up, he did,

en tuck his lantern en shoved out thoo de storm en dug her up en got de

golden arm; en he bent his head down 'gin de win', en plowed en plowed

en plowed thoo de snow. Den all on a sudden he stop (make a considerable

pause here, and look startled, and take a listening attitude) en say:

“My LAN', what's dat!”



En he listen--en listen--en de win' say (set your teeth together and

imitate the wailing and wheezing singsong of the wind), “Bzzz-z-zzz”--en

den, way back yonder whah de grave is, he hear a voice!

he hear a voice all mix' up in de win' can't hardly tell 'em

'part--“Bzzz-zzz--W-h-o--g-o-t--m-y--g-o-l-d-e-n arm?--zzz--zzz--W-h-o

g-o-t m-y g-o-l-d-e-n arm!” (You must begin to shiver violently now.)



En he begin to shiver en shake, en say, “Oh, my! OH, my lan'!” en de

win' blow de lantern out, en de snow en sleet blow in his face en mos'

choke him, en he start a-plowin' knee-deep towards home mos' dead, he so

sk'yerd--en pooty soon he hear de voice agin, en (pause) it 'us comin'

after him! “Bzzz--zzz--zzz--W-h-o--g-o-t m-y--g-o-l-d-e-n--arm?”



When he git to de pasture he hear it agin closter now, en

a-comin'!--a-comin' back dah in de dark en de storm--(repeat the wind

and the voice). When he git to de house he rush up-stairs en jump in de

bed en kiver up, head and years, en lay dah shiverin' en shakin'--en

den way out dah he hear it agin!--en a-comin'! En bimeby he hear

(pause--awed, listening attitude)--pat--pat--pat--hit's acomin'

up-stairs! Den he hear de latch, en he know it's in de room!



Den pooty soon he know it's a-stannin' by de bed! (Pause.) Den--he

know it's a-bendin' down over him--en he cain't skasely git his breath!

Den--den--he seem to feel someth' n c-o-l-d, right down 'most agin his

head! (Pause.)



Den de voice say, right at his year--“W-h-o g-o-t--m-y--g-o-l-d-e-n

arm?” (You must wail it out very plaintively and accusingly; then you

stare steadily and impressively into the face of the farthest-gone

auditor--a girl, preferably--and let that awe-inspiring pause begin to

build itself in the deep hush. When it has reached exactly the right

length, jump suddenly at that girl and yell, “You've got it!”)



If you've got the pause right, she'll fetch a dear little yelp and

spring right out of her shoes. But you must get the pause right; and you

will find it the most troublesome and aggravating and uncertain thing

you ever undertook.















MENTAL TELEGRAPHY AGAIN



I have three or four curious incidents to tell about. They seem to come

under the head of what I named “Mental Telegraphy” in a paper written

seventeen years ago, and published long afterwards.--[The paper entitled

“Mental Telegraphy,” which originally appeared in Harper's Magazine for

December, 1893, is included in the volume entitled The American Claimant

and Other Stories and Sketches.]



Several years ago I made a campaign on the platform with Mr. George W.

Cable. In Montreal we were honored with a reception. It began at two in

the afternoon in a long drawing-room in the Windsor Hotel. Mr. Cable and

I stood at one end of this room, and the ladies and gentlemen entered

it at the other end, crossed it at that end, then came up the long

left-hand side, shook hands with us, said a word or two, and passed on,

in the usual way. My sight is of the telescopic sort, and I presently

recognized a familiar face among the throng of strangers drifting in

at the distant door, and I said to myself, with surprise and high

gratification, “That is Mrs. R.; I had forgotten that she was a

Canadian.” She had been a great friend of mine in Carson City, Nevada,

in the early days. I had not seen her or heard of her for twenty years;

I had not been thinking about her; there was nothing to suggest her to

me, nothing to bring her to my mind; in fact, to me she had long ago

ceased to exist, and had disappeared from my consciousness. But I knew

her instantly; and I saw her so clearly that I was able to note some of

the particulars of her dress, and did note them, and they remained in my

mind. I was impatient for her to come. In the midst of the hand-shakings

I snatched glimpses of her and noted her progress with the slow-moving

file across the end of the room; then I saw her start up the side, and

this gave me a full front view of her face. I saw her last when she

was within twenty-five feet of me. For an hour I kept thinking she

must still be in the room somewhere and would come at last, but I was

disappointed.



When I arrived in the lecture-hall that evening some one said: “Come

into the waiting-room; there's a friend of yours there who wants to see

you. You'll not be introduced--you are to do the recognizing without

help if you can.”



I said to myself: “It is Mrs. R.; I shan't have any trouble.”



There were perhaps ten ladies present, all seated. In the midst of them

was Mrs. R., as I had expected. She was dressed exactly as she was when

I had seen her in the afternoon. I went forward and shook hands with her

and called her by name, and said:



“I knew you the moment you appeared at the reception this afternoon.”

 She looked surprised, and said: “But I was not at the reception. I have

just arrived from Quebec, and have not been in town an hour.”



It was my turn to be surprised now. I said: “I can't help it. I give you

my word of honor that it is as I say. I saw you at the reception, and

you were dressed precisely as you are now. When they told me a moment

ago that I should find a friend in this room, your image rose before me,

dress and all, just as I had seen you at the reception.”



Those are the facts. She was not at the reception at all, or anywhere

near it; but I saw her there nevertheless, and most clearly and

unmistakably. To that I could make oath. How is one to explain this? I

was not thinking of her at the time; had not thought of her for years.

But she had been thinking of me, no doubt; did her thoughts flit through

leagues of air to me, and bring with it that clear and pleasant vision

of herself? I think so. That was and remains my sole experience in

the matter of apparitions--I mean apparitions that come when one

is (ostensibly) awake. I could have been asleep for a moment; the

apparition could have been the creature of a dream. Still, that is

nothing to the point; the feature of interest is the happening of the

thing just at that time, instead of at an earlier or later time, which

is argument that its origin lay in thought-transference.



My next incident will be set aside by most persons as being merely a

“coincidence,” I suppose. Years ago I used to think sometimes of making

a lecturing trip through the antipodes and the borders of the Orient,

but always gave up the idea, partly because of the great length of the

journey and partly because my wife could not well manage to go with me.

Towards the end of last January that idea, after an interval of years,

came suddenly into my head again--forcefully, too, and without any

apparent reason. Whence came it? What suggested it? I will touch upon

that presently.



I was at that time where I am now--in Paris. I wrote at once to Henry

M. Stanley (London), and asked him some questions about his Australian

lecture tour, and inquired who had conducted him and what were the

terms. After a day or two his answer came. It began:



          “The lecture agent for Australia and New Zealand is par

          excellence Mr.  R. S. Smythe, of Melbourne.”



He added his itinerary, terms, sea expenses, and some other matters,

and advised me to write Mr. Smythe, which I did--February 3d. I began my

letter by saying in substance that while he did not know me personally

we had a mutual friend in Stanley, and that would answer for an

introduction. Then I proposed my trip, and asked if he would give me the

same terms which he had given Stanley.



I mailed my letter to Mr. Smythe February 6th, and three days later I

got a letter from the selfsame Smythe, dated Melbourne, December 17th.

I would as soon have expected to get a letter from the late George

Washington. The letter began somewhat as mine to him had begun--with a

self-introduction:



          “DEAR MR. CLEMENS,--It is so long since Archibald Forbes and I

          spent that pleasant afternoon in your comfortable house at

          Hartford that you have probably quite forgotten the occasion.”



In the course of his letter this occurs:



          “I am willing to give you” [here he named the terms which he

          had given Stanley] “for an antipodean tour to last, say, three

          months.”



Here was the single essential detail of my letter answered three days

after I had mailed my inquiry. I might have saved myself the trouble and

the postage--and a few years ago I would have done that very thing, for

I would have argued that my sudden and strong impulse to write and ask

some questions of a stranger on the under side of the globe meant

that the impulse came from that stranger, and that he would answer my

questions of his own motion if I would let him alone.



Mr. Smythe's letter probably passed under my nose on its way to lose

three weeks traveling to America and back, and gave me a whiff of its

contents as it went along. Letters often act like that. Instead of the

thought coming to you in an instant from Australia, the (apparently)

unsentient letter imparts it to you as it glides invisibly past your

elbow in the mail-bag.



Next incident. In the following month--March--I was in America. I spent

a Sunday at Irvington-on-the-Hudson with Mr. John Brisben Walker, of the

Cosmopolitan magazine. We came into New York next morning, and went to

the Century Club for luncheon. He said some praiseful things about the

character of the club and the orderly serenity and pleasantness of its

quarters, and asked if I had never tried to acquire membership in it. I

said I had not, and that New York clubs were a continuous expense to the

country members without being of frequent use or benefit to them.



“And now I've got an idea!” said I. “There's the Lotos--the first New

York club I was ever a member of--my very earliest love in that line.

I have been a member of it for considerably more than twenty years, yet

have seldom had a chance to look in and see the boys. They turn gray

and grow old while I am not watching. And my dues go on. I am going to

Hartford this afternoon for a day or two, but as soon as I get back I

will go to John Elderkin very privately and say: 'Remember the veteran

and confer distinction upon him, for the sake of old times. Make me an

honorary member and abolish the tax. If you haven't any such thing as

honorary membership, all the better--create it for my honor and glory.'

That would be a great thing; I will go to John Elderkin as soon as I get

back from Hartford.”



I took the last express that afternoon, first telegraphing Mr. F. G.

Whitmore to come and see me next day. When he came he asked: “Did you

get a letter from Mr. John Elderkin, secretary of the Lotos Club, before

you left New York?”



“Then it just missed you. If I had known you were coming I would

have kept it. It is beautiful, and will make you proud. The Board of

Directors, by unanimous vote, have made you a life member, and squelched

those dues; and, you are to be on hand and receive your distinction

on the night of the 30th, which is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the

founding of the club, and it will not surprise me if they have some

great times there.”



What put the honorary membership in my head that day in the Century

Club? for I had never thought of it before. I don't know what brought

the thought to me at that particular time instead of earlier, but I am

well satisfied that it originated with the Board of Directors, and had

been on its way to my brain through the air ever since the moment that

saw their vote recorded.



Another incident. I was in Hartford two or three days as a guest of the

Rev. Joseph H. Twichell. I have held the rank of Honorary Uncle to his

children for a quarter of a century, and I went out with him in the

trolley-car to visit one of my nieces, who is at Miss Porter's famous

school in Farmington. The distance is eight or nine miles. On the way,

talking, I illustrated something with an anecdote. This is the anecdote:



Two years and a half ago I and the family arrived at Milan on our way to

Rome, and stopped at the Continental. After dinner I went below and took

a seat in the stone-paved court, where the customary lemon-trees stand

in the customary tubs, and said to myself, “Now this is comfort, comfort

and repose, and nobody to disturb it; I do not know anybody in Milan.”



Then a young gentleman stepped up and shook hands, which damaged my

theory. He said, in substance:



“You won't remember me, Mr. Clemens, but I remember you very well. I was

a cadet at West Point when you and Rev. Joseph H. Twichell came there

some years ago and talked to us on a Hundredth Night. I am a lieutenant

in the regular army now, and my name is H. I am in Europe, all alone,

for a modest little tour; my regiment is in Arizona.”



We became friendly and sociable, and in the course of the talk he told

me of an adventure which had befallen him--about to this effect:



“I was at Bellagio, stopping at the big hotel there, and ten days ago I

lost my letter of credit. I did not know what in the world to do. I was

a stranger; I knew no one in Europe; I hadn't a penny in my pocket; I

couldn't even send a telegram to London to get my lost letter replaced;

my hotel bill was a week old, and the presentation of it imminent--so

imminent that it could happen at any moment now. I was so frightened

that my wits seemed to leave me. I tramped and tramped, back and forth,

like a crazy person. If anybody approached me I hurried away, for no

matter what a person looked like, I took him for the head waiter with

the bill.



“I was at last in such a desperate state that I was ready to do any wild

thing that promised even the shadow of help, and so this is the insane

thing that I did. I saw a family lunching at a small table on the

veranda, and recognized their nationality--Americans--father, mother,

and several young daughters--young, tastefully dressed, and pretty--the

rule with our people. I went straight there in my civilian costume,

named my name, said I was a lieutenant in the army, and told my story

and asked for help.



“What do you suppose the gentleman did? But you would not guess in

twenty years. He took out a handful of gold coin and told me to help

myself--freely. That is what he did.”



The next morning the lieutenant told me his new letter of credit had

arrived in the night, so we strolled to Cook's to draw money to pay

back the benefactor with. We got it, and then went strolling through

the great arcade. Presently he said, “Yonder they are; come and be

introduced.” I was introduced to the parents and the young ladies; then

we separated, and I never saw him or them any m---



“Here we are at Farmington,” said Twichell, interrupting.



We left the trolley-car and tramped through the mud a hundred yards or

so to the school, talking about the time we and Warner walked out there

years ago, and the pleasant time we had.



We had a visit with my niece in the parlor, then started for the trolley

again. Outside the house we encountered a double rank of twenty or

thirty of Miss Porter's young ladies arriving from a walk, and we stood

aside, ostensibly to let them have room to file past, but really to look

at them. Presently one of them stepped out of the rank and said:



“You don't know me, Mr. Twichell; but I know your daughter, and that

gives me the privilege of shaking hands with you.”



Then she put out her hand to me, and said:



“And I wish to shake hands with you too, Mr. Clemens. You don't remember

me, but you were introduced to me in the arcade in Milan two years and a

half ago by Lieutenant H.”



What had put that story into my head after all that stretch of time?

Was it just the proximity of that young girl, or was it merely an odd

accident?















THE INVALID'S STORY



I seem sixty and married, but these effects are due to my condition and

sufferings, for I am a bachelor, and only forty-one. It will be hard for

you to believe that I, who am now but a shadow, was a hale, hearty man

two short years ago, a man of iron, a very athlete!--yet such is the

simple truth. But stranger still than this fact is the way in which I

lost my health. I lost it through helping to take care of a box of guns

on a two-hundred-mile railway journey one winter's night. It is the

actual truth, and I will tell you about it.



I belong in Cleveland, Ohio. One winter's night, two years ago, I

reached home just after dark, in a driving snow-storm, and the first

thing I heard when I entered the house was that my dearest boyhood

friend and schoolmate, John B. Hackett, had died the day before, and

that his last utterance had been a desire that I would take his remains

home to his poor old father and mother in Wisconsin. I was greatly

shocked and grieved, but there was no time to waste in emotions; I must

start at once. I took the card, marked “Deacon Levi Hackett, Bethlehem,

Wisconsin,” and hurried off through the whistling storm to the railway

station. Arrived there I found the long white-pine box which had been

described to me; I fastened the card to it with some tacks, saw it put

safely aboard the express car, and then ran into the eating-room

to provide myself with a sandwich and some cigars. When I returned,

presently, there was my coffin-box back again, apparently, and a young

fellow examining around it, with a card in his hands, and some tacks and

a hammer! I was astonished and puzzled. He began to nail on his card,

and I rushed out to the express car, in a good deal of a state of mind,

to ask for an explanation. But no--there was my box, all right, in the

express car; it hadn't been disturbed. [The fact is that without my

suspecting it a prodigious mistake had been made. I was carrying off a

box of guns which that young fellow had come to the station to ship to a

rifle company in Peoria, Illinois, and he had got my corpse!] Just then

the conductor sung out “All aboard,” and I jumped into the express car

and got a comfortable seat on a bale of buckets. The expressman was

there, hard at work,--a plain man of fifty, with a simple, honest,

good-natured face, and a breezy, practical heartiness in his general

style. As the train moved off a stranger skipped into the car and set a

package of peculiarly mature and capable Limburger cheese on one end of

my coffin-box--I mean my box of guns. That is to say, I know now that it

was Limburger cheese, but at that time I never had heard of the article

in my life, and of course was wholly ignorant of its character. Well,

we sped through the wild night, the bitter storm raged on, a cheerless

misery stole over me, my heart went down, down, down! The old expressman

made a brisk remark or two about the tempest and the arctic weather,

slammed his sliding doors to, and bolted them, closed his window down

tight, and then went bustling around, here and there and yonder, setting

things to rights, and all the time contentedly humming “Sweet By and

By,” in a low tone, and flatting a good deal. Presently I began to

detect a most evil and searching odor stealing about on the frozen air.

This depressed my spirits still more, because of course I attributed

it to my poor departed friend. There was something infinitely saddening

about his calling himself to my remembrance in this dumb pathetic way,

so it was hard to keep the tears back. Moreover, it distressed me on

account of the old expressman, who, I was afraid, might notice it.

However, he went humming tranquilly on, and gave no sign; and for this I

was grateful. Grateful, yes, but still uneasy; and soon I began to feel

more and more uneasy every minute, for every minute that went by that

odor thickened up the more, and got to be more and more gamey and hard

to stand. Presently, having got things arranged to his satisfaction, the

expressman got some wood and made up a tremendous fire in his stove.



This distressed me more than I can tell, for I could not but feel that

it was a mistake. I was sure that the effect would be deleterious upon

my poor departed friend. Thompson--the expressman's name was Thompson,

as I found out in the course of the night--now went poking around his

car, stopping up whatever stray cracks he could find, remarking that

it didn't make any difference what kind of a night it was outside,

he calculated to make us comfortable, anyway. I said nothing, but I

believed he was not choosing the right way. Meantime he was humming to

himself just as before; and meantime, too, the stove was getting hotter

and hotter, and the place closer and closer. I felt myself growing pale

and qualmish, but grieved in silence and said nothing.



Soon I noticed that the “Sweet By and By” was gradually fading out; next

it ceased altogether, and there was an ominous stillness. After a few

moments Thompson said,



“Pfew! I reckon it ain't no cinnamon 't I've loaded up thish-yer stove

with!”



He gasped once or twice, then moved toward the cof--gun-box, stood over

that Limburger cheese part of a moment, then came back and sat down near

me, looking a good deal impressed. After a contemplative pause, he said,

indicating the box with a gesture,



“Friend of yourn?”



“Yes,” I said with a sigh.



“He's pretty ripe, ain't he!”



Nothing further was said for perhaps a couple of minutes, each being

busy with his own thoughts; then Thompson said, in a low, awed voice,



“Sometimes it's uncertain whether they're really gone or not,--seem

gone, you know--body warm, joints limber--and so, although you think

they're gone, you don't really know. I've had cases in my car. It's

perfectly awful, becuz you don't know what minute they'll rise up and

look at you!” Then, after a pause, and slightly lifting his elbow toward

the box,--“But he ain't in no trance! No, sir, I go bail for him!”



We sat some time, in meditative silence, listening to the wind and the

roar of the train; then Thompson said, with a good deal of feeling,



“Well-a-well, we've all got to go, they ain't no getting around it. Man

that is born of woman is of few days and far between, as Scriptur' says.

Yes, you look at it any way you want to, it's awful solemn and cur'us:

they ain't nobody can get around it; all's got to go--just everybody, as

you may say. One day you're hearty and strong”--here he scrambled to his

feet and broke a pane and stretched his nose out at it a moment or two,

then sat down again while I struggled up and thrust my nose out at the

same place, and this we kept on doing every now and then--“and next day

he's cut down like the grass, and the places which knowed him then knows

him no more forever, as Scriptur' says. Yes'ndeedy, it's awful solemn

and cur'us; but we've all got to go, one time or another; they ain't no

getting around it.”



There was another long pause; then,--



“What did he die of?”



I said I didn't know.



“How long has he ben dead?”



It seemed judicious to enlarge the facts to fit the probabilities; so I

said,



“Two or three days.”



But it did no good; for Thompson received it with an injured look which

plainly said, “Two or three years, you mean.” Then he went right along,

placidly ignoring my statement, and gave his views at considerable

length upon the unwisdom of putting off burials too long. Then he

lounged off toward the box, stood a moment, then came back on a sharp

trot and visited the broken pane, observing,



“'Twould 'a' ben a dum sight better, all around, if they'd started him

along last summer.”



Thompson sat down and buried his face in his red silk handkerchief, and

began to slowly sway and rock his body like one who is doing his best

to endure the almost unendurable. By this time the fragrance--if you may

call it fragrance--was just about suffocating, as near as you can come

at it. Thompson's face was turning gray; I knew mine hadn't any color

left in it. By and by Thompson rested his forehead in his left hand,

with his elbow on his knee, and sort of waved his red handkerchief

towards the box with his other hand, and said,--



“I've carried a many a one of 'em,--some of 'em considerable overdue,

too,--but, lordy, he just lays over 'em all!--and does it easy Cap.,

they was heliotrope to HIM!”



This recognition of my poor friend gratified me, in spite of the sad

circumstances, because it had so much the sound of a compliment.



Pretty soon it was plain that something had got to be done. I suggested

cigars. Thompson thought it was a good idea. He said,



“Likely it'll modify him some.”



We puffed gingerly along for a while, and tried hard to imagine that

things were improved. But it wasn't any use. Before very long, and

without any consultation, both cigars were quietly dropped from our

nerveless fingers at the same moment. Thompson said, with a sigh,



“No, Cap., it don't modify him worth a cent. Fact is, it makes him

worse, becuz it appears to stir up his ambition. What do you reckon we

better do, now?”



I was not able to suggest anything; indeed, I had to be swallowing and

swallowing, all the time, and did not like to trust myself to speak.

Thompson fell to maundering, in a desultory and low-spirited way, about

the miserable experiences of this night; and he got to referring to my

poor friend by various titles,--sometimes military ones, sometimes civil

ones; and I noticed that as fast as my poor friend's effectiveness grew,

Thompson promoted him accordingly,--gave him a bigger title. Finally he

said,



“I've got an idea. Suppos' n we buckle down to it and give the Colonel a

bit of a shove towards t'other end of the car?--about ten foot, say. He

wouldn't have so much influence, then, don't you reckon?”



I said it was a good scheme. So we took in a good fresh breath at the

broken pane, calculating to hold it till we got through; then we went

there and bent over that deadly cheese and took a grip on the box.

Thompson nodded “All ready,” and then we threw ourselves forward with

all our might; but Thompson slipped, and slumped down with his nose

on the cheese, and his breath got loose. He gagged and gasped, and

floundered up and made a break for the door, pawing the air and saying

hoarsely, “Don't hender me!--gimme the road! I'm a-dying; gimme the

road!” Out on the cold platform I sat down and held his head a while,

and he revived. Presently he said,



“Do you reckon we started the Gen'rul any?”



I said no; we hadn't budged him.



“Well, then, that idea's up the flume. We got to think up something

else. He's suited wher' he is, I reckon; and if that's the way he feels

about it, and has made up his mind that he don't wish to be disturbed,

you bet he's a-going to have his own way in the business. Yes, better

leave him right wher' he is, long as he wants it so; becuz he holds all

the trumps, don't you know, and so it stands to reason that the man that

lays out to alter his plans for him is going to get left.”



But we couldn't stay out there in that mad storm; we should have frozen

to death. So we went in again and shut the door, and began to suffer

once more and take turns at the break in the window. By and by, as

we were starting away from a station where we had stopped a moment,

Thompson pranced in cheerily and exclaimed,



“We're all right, now! I reckon we've got the Commodore this time. I

judge I've got the stuff here that'll take the tuck out of him.”



It was carbolic acid. He had a carboy of it. He sprinkled it all around

everywhere; in fact he drenched everything with it, rifle-box, cheese

and all. Then we sat down, feeling pretty hopeful. But it wasn't for

long. You see the two perfumes began to mix, and then--well, pretty soon

we made a break for the door; and out there Thompson swabbed his face

with his bandanna and said in a kind of disheartened way,



“It ain't no use. We can't buck agin him. He just utilizes everything we

put up to modify him with, and gives it his own flavor and plays it back

on us. Why, Cap., don't you know, it's as much as a hundred times worse

in there now than it was when he first got a-going. I never did see one

of 'em warm up to his work so, and take such a dumnation interest in it.

No, Sir, I never did, as long as I've ben on the road; and I've carried

a many a one of 'em, as I was telling you.”



We went in again after we were frozen pretty stiff; but my, we couldn't

stay in, now. So we just waltzed back and forth, freezing, and thawing,

and stifling, by turns. In about an hour we stopped at another station;

and as we left it Thompson came in with a bag, and said,--



“Cap., I'm a-going to chance him once more,--just this once; and if we

don't fetch him this time, the thing for us to do, is to just throw up

the sponge and withdraw from the canvass. That's the way I put it up.”

 He had brought a lot of chicken feathers, and dried apples, and leaf

tobacco, and rags, and old shoes, and sulphur, and asafoetida, and one

thing or another; and he, piled them on a breadth of sheet iron in the

middle of the floor, and set fire to them.



When they got well started, I couldn't see, myself, how even the corpse

could stand it. All that went before was just simply poetry to that

smell,--but mind you, the original smell stood up out of it just as

sublime as ever,--fact is, these other smells just seemed to give it a

better hold; and my, how rich it was! I didn't make these reflections

there--there wasn't time--made them on the platform. And breaking for

the platform, Thompson got suffocated and fell; and before I got him

dragged out, which I did by the collar, I was mighty near gone myself.

When we revived, Thompson said dejectedly,--



“We got to stay out here, Cap. We got to do it. They ain't no other way.

The Governor wants to travel alone, and he's fixed so he can outvote

us.”



And presently he added,



“And don't you know, we're pisoned. It's our last trip, you can make up

your mind to it. Typhoid fever is what's going to come of this. I feel

it acoming right now. Yes, sir, we're elected, just as sure as you're

born.”



We were taken from the platform an hour later, frozen and insensible,

at the next station, and I went straight off into a virulent fever, and

never knew anything again for three weeks. I found out, then, that I

had spent that awful night with a harmless box of rifles and a lot of

innocent cheese; but the news was too late to save me; imagination had

done its work, and my health was permanently shattered; neither Bermuda

nor any other land can ever bring it back tome. This is my last trip; I

am on my way home to die.

                          X MARKS THE PEDWALK



                            BY FRITZ LEIBER



           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

                This is how it all began--the terrible

                civil strife that devastates our world!





    Based in material in Ch. 7--""First Clashes of the Wheeled and

    Footed Sects""--of Vol. 3 of Burger's monumental _History of

    Traffic_, published by the Foundation for Twenty-Second

    Century Studies.



The raggedy little old lady with the big shopping bag was in the exact

center of the crosswalk when she became aware of the big black car

bearing down on her.



Behind the thick bullet-proof glass its seven occupants had a misty

look, like men in a diving bell.



She saw there was no longer time to beat the car to either curb.

Veering remorselessly, it would catch her in the gutter.



Useless to attempt a feint and double-back, such as any venturesome

child executed a dozen times a day. Her reflexes were too slow.



Polite vacuous laughter came from the car's loudspeaker over the

engine's mounting roar.



From her fellow pedestrians lining the curbs came a sigh of horror.



The little old lady dipped into her shopping bag and came up with a big

blue-black automatic. She held it in both fists, riding the recoils

like a rodeo cowboy on a bucking bronco.



Aiming at the base of the windshield, just as a big-game hunter aims

at the vulnerable spine of a charging water buffalo over the horny

armor of its lowered head, the little old lady squeezed off three shots

before the car chewed her down.



From the right-hand curb a young woman in a wheelchair shrieked an

obscenity at the car's occupants.



Smythe-de Winter, the driver, wasn't happy. The little old lady's

last shot had taken two members of his car pool. Bursting through the

laminated glass, the steel-jacketed slug had traversed the neck of

Phipps-McHeath and buried itself in the skull of Horvendile-Harker.



Braking viciously, Smythe-de Winter rammed the car over the right-hand

curb. Pedestrians scattered into entries and narrow arcades, among them

a youth bounding high on crutches.



But Smythe-de Winter got the girl in the wheelchair.



Then he drove rapidly out of the Slum Ring into the Suburbs, a shred

of rattan swinging from the flange of his right fore mudguard for

a trophy. Despite the two-for-two casualty list, he felt angry and

depressed. The secure, predictable world around him seemed to be

crumbling.



       *       *       *       *       *



While his companions softly keened a dirge to Horvy and Phipps and

quietly mopped up their blood, he frowned and shook his head.



""They oughtn't to let old ladies carry magnums,"" he murmured.



Witherspoon-Hobbs nodded agreement across the front-seat corpse. ""They

oughtn't to let 'em carry anything. God, how I hate Feet,"" he muttered,

looking down at his shrunken legs. ""Wheels forever!"" he softly cheered.



The incident had immediate repercussions throughout the city. At the

combined wake of the little old lady and the girl in the wheelchair,

a fiery-tongued speaker inveighed against the White-Walled Fascists

of Suburbia, telling to his hearers, the fabled wonders of old Los

Angeles, where pedestrians were sacrosanct, even outside crosswalks. He

called for a hobnail march across the nearest lawn-bowling alleys and

perambulator-traversed golf courses of the motorists.



At the Sunnyside Crematorium, to which the bodies of Phipps and Horvy

had been conveyed, an equally impassioned and rather more grammatical

orator reminded his listeners of the legendary justice of old Chicago,

where pedestrians were forbidden to carry small arms and anyone with

one foot off the sidewalk was fair prey. He broadly hinted that a

holocaust, primed if necessary with a few tankfuls of gasoline, was the

only cure for the Slums.



Bands of skinny youths came loping at dusk out of the Slum Ring into

the innermost sections of the larger doughnut of the Suburbs slashing

defenseless tires, shooting expensive watchdogs and scrawling filthy

words on the pristine panels of matrons' runabouts which never ventured

more than six blocks from home.



Simultaneously squadrons of young suburban motorcycles and scooterites

roared through the outermost precincts of the Slum Ring, harrying

children off sidewalks, tossing stink-bombs through second-story

tenement windows and defacing hovel-fronts with sprays of black paint.



Incident--a thrown brick, a cut corner, monster tacks in the portico

of the Auto Club--were even reported from the center of the city,

traditionally neutral territory.



The Government hurriedly acted, suspending all traffic between the

Center and the Suburbs and establishing a 24-hour curfew in the Slum

Ring. Government agents moved only by centipede-car and pogo-hopper to

underline the point that they favored neither contending side.



The day of enforced non-movement for Feet and Wheels was spent in

furtive vengeful preparations. Behind locked garage doors, machine-guns

that fired through the nose ornament were mounted under hoods, illegal

scythe blades were welded to oversize hubcaps and the stainless steel

edges of flange fenders were honed to razor sharpness.



While nervous National Guardsmen hopped about the deserted sidewalks of

the Slum Ring, grim-faced men and women wearing black armbands moved

through the webwork of secret tunnels and hidden doors, distributing

heavy-caliber small arms and spike-studded paving blocks, piling

cobblestones on strategic roof-tops and sapping upward from the secret

tunnels to create car-traps. Children got ready to soap intersections

after dark. The Committee of Pedestrian Safety, sometimes known as

Robespierre's Rats, prepared to release its two carefully hoarded

anti-tank guns.



       *       *       *       *       *



At nightfall, under the tireless urging of the Government,

representatives of the Pedestrians and the Motorists met on a huge

safety island at the boundary of the Slum Ring and the Suburbs.



Underlings began a noisy dispute as to whether Smythe-de Winter had

failed to give a courtesy honk before charging, whether the little old

lady had opened fire before the car had come within honking distance,

how many wheels of Smythe-de's car had been on the sidewalk when he hit

the girl in the wheelchair and so on. After a little while the High

Pedestrian and the Chief Motorist exchanged cautious winks and drew

aside.



The red writhing of a hundred kerosene flares and the mystic yellow

pulsing of a thousand firefly lamps mounted on yellow sawhorses ranged

around the safety island illumined two tragic, strained faces.



""A word before we get down to business,"" the Chief Motorist whispered.

""What's the current S.Q. of your adults?""



""Forty-one and dropping,"" the High Pedestrian replied, his eyes

fearfully searching from side to side for eavesdroppers. ""I can hardly

get aides who are halfway _compos mentis_.""



""Our own Sanity Quotient is thirty-seven,"" the Chief Motorist revealed.

He shrugged helplessly.... ""The wheels inside my people's heads are

slowing down. I do not think they will be speeded up in my lifetime.""



""They say Government's only fifty-two,"" the other said with a matching

shrug.



""Well, I suppose we must scrape out one more compromise,"" the one

suggested hollowly, ""though I must confess there are times when I think

we're all the figments of a paranoid's dream.""



Two hours of concentrated deliberations produced the new Wheel-Foot

Articles of Agreement. Among other points, pedestrian handguns were

limited to a slightly lower muzzle velocity and to .38 caliber and

under, while motorists were required to give three honks at one block

distance before charging a pedestrian in a crosswalk. Two wheels over

the curb changed a traffic kill from third-degree manslaughter to petty

homicide. Blind pedestrians were permitted to carry hand grenades.



Immediately the Government went to work. The new Wheel-Foot Articles

were loudspeakered and posted. Detachments of police and psychiatric

social hoppers centipedaled and pogoed through the Slum Ring, seizing

outsize weapons and giving tranquilizing jet-injections to the unruly.

Teams of hypnotherapists and mechanics scuttled from home to home

in the Suburbs and from garage to garage, in-chanting a conformist

serenity and stripping illegal armament from cars. On the advice of

a rogue psychiatrist, who said it would channel off aggressions, a

display of bull-fighting was announced, but this had to be canceled

when a strong protest was lodged by the Decency League, which had a

large mixed Wheel-Foot membership.



At dawn, curfew was lifted in the Slum Ring and traffic reopened

between the Suburbs and the Center. After a few uneasy moments it

became apparent that the _status quo_ had been restored.



       *       *       *       *       *



Smythe-de Winter tooled his gleaming black machine along the Ring. A

thick steel bolt with a large steel washer on either side neatly filled

the hole the little old lady's slug had made in the windshield.



A brick bounced off the roof. Bullets pattered against the side

windows.



Smythe-de ran a handkerchief around his neck under his collar and

smiled.



A block ahead children were darting into the street, cat-calling and

thumbing their noses. Behind one of them limped a fat dog with a spiked

collar.



Smythe-de suddenly gunned his motor. He didn't hit any of the children,

but he got the dog.



A flashing light on the dash showed him the right front tire was losing

pressure. Must have hit the collar as well! He thumbed the matching

emergency-air button and the flashing stopped.



He turned toward Witherspoon-Hobbs and said with thoughtful

satisfaction, ""I like a normal orderly world, where you always have a

little success, but not champagne-heady; a little failure, but just

enough to brace you.""



Witherspoon-Hobbs was squinting at the next crosswalk. Its center was

discolored by a brownish stain ribbon-tracked by tires.



""That's where you bagged the little old lady, Smythe-de,"" he remarked.

""I'll say this for her now: she had spirit.""



""Yes, that's where I bagged her,"" Smythe-de agreed flatly. He

remembered wistfully the witchlike face growing rapidly larger, her

jerking shoulders in black bombazine, the wild white-circled eyes. He

suddenly found himself feeling that this was a very dull day.

                               THE DRUG



                            By C. C. MacAPP



                        Illustrated by MARTINEZ



           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

             It could be deadly. It had to be tested. But

             Sales wanted a new product this very minute.





Amos Parry, a regional manager for Whelan, Inc. (Farm & Ranch Chemicals

& Feeds), had come to work a few minutes early and was waiting in the

lab when Frank Barnes arrived. He saw that the division's chief chemist

was even more nervous than usual, so he invested a few minutes in

soothing small talk before saying, ""Frank, Sales is beginning to push

for that new hormone.""



Immediately, Barnes came unsoothed. ""Bill Detrick was on the phone

about it yesterday, Mr. Parry. I'm sorry I was abrupt with him.""



Amos grinned. ""If you were, he hasn't had a chance to mention it to

me yet. But I think we'd better light a fire under the thing. We'll

probably get a blast from Buffalo before long. How many men do you have

on it?""



""Well, two helping with routine work, but I've done most of it myself,

evenings and weekends. I didn't want anybody to know too much about it.

Mr. Parry, I'm worried about it.""



""Worried? How do you mean?""



""Well--let me show you the litter we've been testing it on.""



The pigs were in pens outside the lab. Amos had seen figures on

weight gain and general health (the latter was what promised to be

sensational) but hadn't seen the animals for two weeks. He eyed the

first bunch. ""How old is that boar pig?""



""Not quite four months.""



Amos was no expert, but he'd spent many hours on customers' farms and

he thought the animal looked more mature than that. So did the shoats

in the same pen, though they tended more to fat. All of the group had

an odd look, certainly not normal for Yorkshires of their age. He

thought of wild hogs. ""Is it just the general health factor?"" he asked.



""I don't think so, Mr. Parry. You remember I told you this wasn't

actually a hormone.""



""I know. You wanted to call it that for secrecy, you told me.""



""Yes, sir, but I didn't tell you what it really was. Mr. Parry, are you

familiar with hypnotics? Mescaline, especially?""



""No, I'm not, Frank.""



""Well, it's a drug that causes strong hallucinations. This is a

chemical derivative of it.""



Amos grinned again. ""Pipe dreams for hogs?""



He quit grinning as implications struck him. If this thing didn't pan

out, after the money they'd spent and the rumors that had seeped out,

there'd be some nasty questions from Buffalo. And if it did, and they

began selling it....



""What would it do to human beings?"" asked Amos.



Barnes avoided his eyes. ""That's one of the things I'm worried about,""

he said. ""I want to show you another pig.""



This one was isolated in its own pen, and it looked even stranger than

its siblings. In the first place, its hair was thicker, and black.

There was an oddness in its shape and a vaguely familiar sinuousness in

the way it moved that made Amos' skin prickle.



""What's wrong with it?"" he asked.



""It's healthy except for the way it looks and acts.""



""Same litter and dosage?""



""Yes, sir--all of them got just one dose. The effects seem to be

permanent.""



They were leaning over the fence and the animal was looking up at

them. There was an oddity in its eyes; not intelligence exactly, but

something unpiglike. Abruptly, it stood up on its hind legs, putting

its forefeet against the fence and raising its head toward them.

It squealed as if begging for attention. Amos knew that pigs made

affectionate pets. Drawn to it as well as repelled, he reached down and

patted it, and the squealing stopped.



It was standing too easily in that position, and suddenly Amos

recognized what was familiar about it. He jerked his hand away, feeling

a strong desire for soap and water. ""How long's it been this way?""



""It's changed fast in the last week.""



Amos looked toward the doorway of the lab, just inside of which a large

black tomcat sat watching them. ""Is the cat out here a lot?""



Barnes' eyes went to the cat, widened, and turned back to the pig. He

looked as ill as Amos felt.



       *       *       *       *       *



When Amos got to his office, his sales manager was already waiting.

His mind only half present, Amos sized up the stuffed briefcase and

the wider-than-necessary smile as he responded automatically to the

amenities. ""Just get back?"" he asked.



""Early train. Darned planes grounded again."" Detrick looked full of

energy, though he'd undoubtedly rushed home, shaved, showered and

changed, and hurried to the office with no rest. He sat down, extracted

papers from the briefcase, and beamed, ""Wrote up the Peach Association.""



He'll give me the good news first, Amos thought. ""Fine, fine,"" he said.

""The whole year?""



""Yep. Got a check from the Almond Growers, too. All paid up now.""



""Good,"" said Amos, and waited.



It came. ""Say, I was talking to Frank Barnes about that new hormone

he's got and he seemed a little negative about it. When do you think we

can have it?""



It was a temptation to answer with false optimisms and duck the issue

for a while, but Amos said, ""The slowest thing will be State and

Federal testing and registration. I'd say not less than a year.""



Detrick nodded. ""Competition's selling more and more stuff that's not

registered.""



""Fly-by-night outfits and they're always getting caught.""



Detrick smiled. ""Every night they fly away with more business.""



Amos managed a smile, though the argument was old and weary. ""We'll

put it up to Buffalo if you want to, Bill. You know I can't okay it

myself.""



Detrick dropped the subject, not being a man to beat his head against

a stone wall if there were ways around it, and for the next hour Amos

had to listen to the troubles: competition had cut prices on this,

upped active ingredients in that, put such and such a new product on

the market (Whelan's factories and warehouses already groaned under a

crippling diversity of products but Sales didn't feel that was _their_

problem) and even the credit policies needed revising. But the worst

of all was a fifteen-thousand-dollar claim for damage to pear trees,

caused by a bad batch of Whelan's arsenical insecticide.



Amos got rid of Detrick with a few definite concessions, some tentative

ones, and some stand-offs. He made sure no one was waiting to see him

and told his secretary he didn't want to be bothered before lunch.



He had a lunch date with a customer and dreaded it--it meant three or

four highballs and overeating and an upset stomach later. Before then,

though, he had a few minutes to try to get his mind straightened out.

He mixed a glassful of the stuff he was supposed to take about now.

The Compleat Executive, he thought; with physician and prescription

attached. It didn't seem possible that this same body had once breezed

through anything from football to fried potatoes.



Mechanically, his mind on the lab's pigs, he got a small bag of grain

out of a desk drawer. He hoped nobody (except his secretary, of course)

knew he wasted time feeding pigeons, but it helped his nerves, and he

felt he had a right to one or two eccentricities.



They were already waiting. Some of them knew him and didn't shoo off

when he opened the window and scattered grain on the ledge outside. A

few ate from his hand.



It was a crisp day, but the sun slanting into the window was warm.

He leaned there, watching the birds--more were circling in now--and

looking out over the industrial part of the city. The rude shapes were

softened by haze and there was nothing noisy close by. He could almost

imagine it as some country landscape.



He looked at his watch, sighed, pulled his head in and shut the window.

The air conditioner's hiss replaced the outside sounds.



Not even imagination could get rid of the city for long.



       *       *       *       *       *



Going through the outer office, he saw that Alice Grant, his secretary,

already had her lunch out on her desk. She was a young thirty, not very

tall and just inclined to plumpness. She wore her blonde hair pulled

back into a knot that didn't succeed in making her look severe, and her

features were well-formed and regular, if plain. Amos noticed a new

bruise on one cheek and wondered how long she'd stay with her sot of a

husband. There were no children to hold her.



""I'll probably be back late,"" he said. ""Anything for this afternoon?""



""Just Jim at two-thirty and the union agent at three.""



The lunch didn't go too badly, lubricated as the customer liked it, and

Amos was feeling only hazily uneasy when he got back.



A stormy session with his plant superintendent jarred him into

the normal disquiet. Jim Glover was furious at having to take the

fifteen-thousand-dollar claim, though it was clearly a factory error.

He also fought a stubborn delaying action before giving Amos a

well-hedged estimate of fifty thousand to equip for the new drug. He

complained that Frank Barnes hadn't given him enough information.



Amos was still trembling from that encounter when the union business

agent arrived. The lunch was beginning to lump up and he didn't spar

effectively. Not that it made much difference. The union was going to

have a raise or else. By the time he'd squirmed through that interview,

then dictated a few letters, it was time to go home.



He hoped his wife would be out so he could take some of his

prescription and relax, but she met him at the door with a verbal

barrage. Their son, nominally a resident of the house, had gotten

ticketed with the college crowd for drunken driving and Amos was to get

it fixed; the Templetons were coming for the weekend; her brother's boy

was graduating and thought he might accept a position with Amos.



She paused and studied him. ""I hope this isn't one of your grumpy

evenings. The Ashtons are coming for bridge.""



His control slipped a little and he expressed himself pungently on

Wednesday night bridge, after a nightclub party on Tuesday and a

formless affair at somebody's house on Monday.



She stared at him without compassion or comprehension. ""Well, they're

all business associates of yours. I wonder where you think you'd be

without a wife who was willing to entertain.""



He'd been getting a lot of that lately; she was squeezing the role

of Executive's Wife for the last drop of satisfaction. Well, since he

couldn't relax with his indigestion there was only one thing to do. He

headed for the bar.



""Now don't get tipsy before dinner,"" she called after him.



He got through the evening well enough, doused with martinis, and the

night that followed was no worse than most.



       *       *       *       *       *



At nine the next morning, the call he'd been expecting from Buffalo

came through. ""Hello, Stu,"" he said to the president of the company.



""Hello, Amos. Still morning out there, eh? How's the family? Good.

Say, Amos; couple of things. This big factory charge. Production's

screaming.""



""It was definitely a bad batch, Stu.""



""Well, that's it, then. Question is, how'd it happen?""



""Jim Glover says he needs another control chemist.""



""Hope you're not practicing false economy out there.""



""We wanted to hire another man, Stu, but Buffalo turned it down.""



""You should have brought it to me personally if it was that important.

It's going to take a big bite out of your year's profit. Been able to

get your margin up any?""



Amos didn't feel up to pointing out that Sales wanted lower prices and

the union wanted higher wages, so that the margin would get even worse.

He described a couple of minor economies he'd been able to find, then

mentioned the contract with the Peach Association.



""Yes, I heard about that,"" said the president of the company. ""Nice

piece of business. By the way, how you coming on that animal hormone?""



That was the main reason for the call, of course. Detrick had

undoubtedly phoned east and intimated that Amos was dragging his feet

on a potential bonanza. ""I was going to call you on that, Stu. It'll

take a year to test and get registered and--""



""Amos, I hope you're not turning conservative on us.""



The message was plain; Amos countered automatically. ""You know me

better than that, Stu. It's the Legal Department I'm worried about. If

they set up a lot of roadblocks, we may need you to run interference.""



""You know I'm always right behind you, Amos.""



That's true, thought Amos as he hung up. Right behind me. A hell of a

place to run interference.



He knew exactly what to expect. If he tried to cut corners, the Legal

Department would scream about proper testing and registration,

Production would say he was pushing Jim Glover unreasonably, and

everyone who could would assume highly moral positions astraddle the

fence. A ton of paperwork would go to Buffalo to be distributed among

fifty desks and expertly stalled.



Not to mention that this was no ordinary product. He realized for the

first time that the Government might not let him produce it, let alone

sell it. Even as a minute percentage in feeds. If it was a narcotic, it

could be misused.



       *       *       *       *       *



His buzzer sounded, and he was surprised when Mrs. Grant announced

Frank Barnes. It was out of character for Frank not to make a formal

appointment first.



One look told Amos what was coming. He listened to Frank's resignation

with a fraction of his mind while the rest of it mused upon the

purposeful way things were converging.



Barnes stopped talking and Amos said mechanically, ""You've been part

of the team for a long time, Frank. It's especially awkward to lose

you just now."" It was banal, but it didn't matter; he wasn't going to

change the man's mind anyway. He looked closer. The timidity was gone.

So were the eyeglasses. A frightening thought struck him. ""You've

taken some of that drug.""



Barnes grinned and handed a small vial full of powder across the desk,

along with a file folder. ""Last night,"" he said. ""Between frustration

with the job and curiosity about this stuff, I yielded to temptation.""



Amos took the vial and folder. ""What are these for?""



""So you can destroy them if you want to. I've doctored up the lab

records to make the whole thing look like a false alarm. You're holding

all that's left of the whole program.""



Amos looked for signs of irrationality and saw none. ""Do you feel all

right?""



""Better than you can imagine. But let me tell you what you're up

against. I can at least do that for you, Mr. Parry.""



""Thanks. Don't you suppose you could call me Amos now?""



""Sure, Amos. First of all, you were right about that pig trying to

imitate the cat. He couldn't do much because he only had a pig's brain

to work with."" He stopped and grinned, evidently at Amos' expression.

""I'll try to explain. What is an animal? Physically, I mean?""



Amos shook his head. ""You've got the floor.""



""All right. An animal is a colony of cells. Different kinds of cells

form organs and do different things for the colony, but each cell has

a life of its own, too. When it dies a new one of the same kind takes

over. But what regulates the colony? What maintains the pattern?""



Amos waited.



""Part of it's automatic replacement, cell for cell. But beyond that

there's a control; and it's the unconscious mind."" He paused and

studied Amos. ""You think I'm theorizing. I'm not. That drug broke down

some barriers, and I see all this as you see your own fingers moving.""



Amos remembered the mention of hallucinations.



       *       *       *       *       *



Barnes grinned again. ""Let's say it's only one per cent awake and

walled off from the conscious mind. What would happen if something

removed the wall and woke up the other ninety-nine per cent?""



Remembering the pig, it was impossible not to feel a cold seed of

belief. Amos dreaded what was coming next; clearly, it would be a

demonstration.



Barnes held out his hand, palm up. In a few seconds a pink spot

appeared. It turned red, oozed dismayingly, and became a small pool

of blood. Barnes let it stay for a moment, then wiped it off with a

handkerchief. There was no more bleeding. ""That's something I can do

fast,"" he said. ""I opened the pores, directed blood to them, then

closed them again. Amos, do you believe in werewolves?""



Amos wanted to jump up and shout, ""No! You're insane!"" but he could

only sit staring.



""I could move that thumb around to the other side of my hand,"" Barnes

said thoughtfully. ""I'm still exploring, but I don't think even the

bone would take too long. You'll notice I don't need glasses any more.""



The buzzer buzzed. Amos jumped, and from habit answered. ""Bill Detrick

and that customer are here, Mr. Parry,"" came Alice Grant's voice.



""I--ask them to wait,"" he managed.



His mind was a muddle; he needed time. ""You--Frank--will you stay for a

few days?""



""Sure. I'm in no hurry now. And while you're thinking, let me give you

a few hints. No more cripples or disease. No ugly people, unless they

choose to be. And no law.""



""No--law?""



""How would you police such a world? A man could change his face at

will, or his fingerprints. Even his teeth. Probably he could do things

I can't imagine yet.""



The buzzer went again, with Mrs. Grant's subtle urgency. Amos ignored

it, yet he hardly knew when Frank left the room.



He realized the chemist had done him a favor. The selfish thing would

have been to keep the secret and the boon all to himself; instead, he'd

given Amos the choice.



But what was the choice? Suppressing the drug would cost him his job.

There was no doubt about that.



He was standing with his back to the door when he heard it open. He

turned and faced Detrick's annoyed frown. ""Amos, we can't keep this man

waiting. He's--""



All of Amos' frustration and the new burden coalesced into rage. He ran

toward Detrick. ""You baboon-faced huckster!"" he yelled. ""Get out! Get

out! I'll tell you when you can come in here!"" He barely caught his

upraised fist in time.



Detrick stood petrified, his face ludicrous. Then he came to life,

ducked out, and pulled the door shut behind him.



Amos waited no longer; if he had to decide, he wanted the data

first-hand. He spread out the file Barnes had left him and looked

through it for dosages. Apparently it wasn't critical, so he poured a

little of the powder into a tumbler, added water and threw it down.

There was a mild alkaline taste, which he washed out of his mouth with

more water. Then he sat down to wait.



       *       *       *       *       *



A monotone seemed to be rattling off trivia; almost faster than he

could grasp it, even though it was in his head and not in his ears:

""Paris green/calcium acetoarsenite/beetle invasion Texan cotton/paint

pigment/obsolete/should eliminate/compensation claim/man probably

faking infection/Detrick likes because we only source/felt like hitting

him when we argued about it/correspondence Buffalo last year/they say

keep/check how use as poison/damned wife--""



The last thought shocked his intellect awake. ""Hey!"" Intellect

demanded. ""What's going on here?""



""Oh; you've broken through,"" said Unconscious. ""That was fast.

Fifteen minutes and twenty-three seconds since you drank it.

Probable error, one-third second. I've only been awake a few minutes

myself. Minute/sixty per hour/twenty-four hours day/days getting

shorter/September/have raincoat in car/wife wants new car/raincoat

sweats plasticizer/stinks/Hyatt used camphor--""



""Hold up a minute!"" cried Intellect.



""You want me to stop scanning?""



""Is that what you're doing? Scanning what?""



""Memory banks, of course. Don't you remember the book we read three

years ago? 'Human brain estimated--' Oh, all right; I'll slow down.

You could follow me better if you'd let me grow some permanent direct

connections.""



""Am I stopping you?""



""Well, not you, exactly. I'll show you."" Unconscious began directing

the growth of certain nerve tendrils in the brain. Amos could only

follow it vaguely.



""Fear!"" screamed a soundless voice. ""Stop!""



""What was that?"" Intellect asked, startled.



""That was Id. He always fights any improvements, and I can't override

him.""



""Can _I_?""



""Of course; that's mainly what you're for. Wait till I get these

connections finished and you'll see the whole setup.""



""FEAR!"" shrieked Id. ""STOP! NO CHANGE!""



""SHUT UP!"" yelled Intellect.



It was strange being integrated; Amos found he was aware on two

levels simultaneously. While he responded normally to his external

environment, a lightning inner vision saw everything in vastly greater

detail. The blink of an eye, for instance, was an amazing project. Even

as commands flashed out and before the muscles started to respond,

extra blood was rushing into the area to nourish the working parts.

Reports flowed back like battle assessments: these three muscles

were on schedule; this was lagging; that was pulling too hard. An

infinitesimal twinge of pain marked some minor accident, and correction

began at once. A censor watched the whole operation and labeled each

incoming report: trivial, do not record; trivial, do not record;

trivial, do not record; worth watching, record in temporary banks;

trivial, do not....



He felt now that he could look forward to permanent health, and so far

he didn't seem to be losing his identity or becoming a moral monster

(though certain previously buried urges--toward Alice Grant, for

instance--were now rather embarrassingly uncovered). He was not, like

Frank Barnes, inclined to slip out of the situation at once. He still

felt the responsibility to make the decision.



He carried the vial of powder and the lab records home with him,

smuggled them past his wife's garrulity (it didn't bother him now)

and hid them. He went out with her cheerfully to visit some people he

didn't like, and found himself amused at them instead of annoyed. In

general, he felt buoyant, and they stayed quite late.



       *       *       *       *       *



When they did get home, an urgent message was waiting on the telephone

recorder, and it jolted him. He grabbed up the hat and coat he'd just

laid down.



""What is it?"" his wife demanded.



""I've got to go down to the plant."" He hesitated; it was hard to say

the words that were charged with personal significance. ""The watchman

found Frank Barnes dead in the laboratory.""



""Who?""



""Frank Barnes! My chief chemist!""



""Oh."" She looked at him, obviously concerned only with what effect, if

any, it might have on her own circumstances. ""Why do you have to get

mixed up in it?""



""I'm the boss, damn it!"" He left her standing there and ran for the

garage.



The police were already at the plant when he arrived. Fred's body lay

on the floor of his office, in a corner behind some file cabinets, face

up.



""What was it?"" Amos asked the man from the coroner's office, dreading

the answer he expected.



The answer wasn't the one he expected. ""Heart attack.""



Amos wondered if they were mistaken. He looked around the office.

Things weren't disarrayed in any way; it looked as if Frank had simply

lain down and died. ""When did you find him?"" he asked the watchman.



""A little after one. The door was closed and the lights were out, but I

heard the cat yowling in here, so I came in to let it out, and saw the

body.""



""Any family?"" one of the city men asked.



""No,"" said Amos slowly, ""he lived alone. I guess you might as well take

him to the ... morgue. When can I call about the autopsy?""



""Try after lunch.""



Amos watched them carry Frank away. Then he put out the lights and

closed up the laboratory. He told the watchman he'd be around for a

while, and went to his office to think.



As nearly as he knew, Frank had taken the drug less than twenty-four

hours before he had. Death had come late at night, which meant Frank

had been working overtime. Why? And why hadn't he been able to save

himself?



""Not logical,"" his unconscious stated firmly. ""He should have felt it

coming and made repairs.""



""This whole thing's a delusion,"" said Amos dully, aloud.



""No, it isn't,"" said a peculiar voice behind him.



He whirled and saw the black tomcat grinning up at him. He gasped,

wondering if he were completely insane, but in a flash understanding

came. ""Frank!""



""Well, don't act so surprised. I can tell that you took some yourself.""



""Yes--but how--""



""I thought it would be an easy life and I want to stay around here and

watch things for a while. It ought to be fun.""



""But _how_?""



""I anesthetized the cat and grew a bridge into his skull. It took five

hours to transfer the bulk of my personality. It's odd, but it blended

right in with his.""



""But--your speech!""



""I've made some changes. I'm omnivorous now, too, not just

carnivorous--or will be in a few more hours. I can go into the hills

and live on grass, or grow back into a man, or whatever I like.""



Amos consulted his own inwardness again. ""Is this possible? Can a human

mind be compressed into a cat's brain?""



""Sure,"" said Unconscious, ""if you're willing to junk all the excess.""



He thought about it. ""So you're going to stay around and watch,"" he

said to the cat--no, Frank. ""An intriguing idea. My family's taken care

of, and nobody'll really miss me.""



""Except Alice Grant,"" said Frank cattily. ""I've seen the way you look

at her. The cat part of me has, I mean. And she looks back, too, when

you aren't watching.""



""Well,"" said Amos. ""Hm. Maybe we can do something there too.""

His own metamorphosis took a lot longer than five hours; he had a much

bigger job of alterations to finish. It was nearly two months before he

got back to the plant.



He peered in through the window at Detrick, who'd inherited Amos' old

office. Detrick was chewing out a salesman. Amos knew what would be

happening now; Derrick's ambitious but unsound expansion would have

gotten the division all tangled up. In fact, with his sharp new eyes,

Amos could read part of a letter from Buffalo that lay on the desk. It

was quite critical of Detrick's margin of profit.



The salesman Detrick had on the carpet was a good man, and Amos

wondered if he was to blame for whatever it was about. Maybe Detrick

was just preparing to throw him to the wolves. A man could hang on a

long time like that, shifting the blame to his subordinates.



The salesman was finally excused, and Detrick sat alone with all the

frustration and selfish scheming plain on his face. No, Amos thought,

I'm not going to turn this drug loose on the world for a while. Not

while there are people like Detrick around.



There were no other pigeons on the window ledge except himself and

Alice; the rest had stopped coming when Amos disappeared and the

feeding ended. For that matter, they tended to avoid him and Alice,

possibly because of the abnormal size, especially around the head, and

the other differences.



He noticed that Alice was changing the color of her feet again. Just

like a woman, he thought fondly.



""Come on, Pigeon,"" he said, ""let's go somewhere else. This tightwad

Detrick isn't going to give us anything to eat.""
